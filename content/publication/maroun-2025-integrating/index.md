abstract: Age estimation from facial images is a complex and multifaceted challenge
  in computer vision. In this study, we present a novel hybrid architecture that combines
  ConvNeXt, a state-of-the-art advancement of convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
  with Vision Transformers (ViT). While each model independently delivers excellent
  performance on a variety of tasks, their integration leverages the complementary
  strengths of the CNNs' localized feature extraction capabilities and the Transformers'
  global attention mechanisms. Our proposed ConvNeXt-ViT hybrid solution was thoroughly
  evaluated on benchmark age estimation datasets, including MORPH II, CACD, and AFAD,
  and achieved superior performance in terms of mean absolute error (MAE). To address
  computational constraints, we leverage pre-trained models and systematically explore
  different configurations, using linear layers and advanced regularization techniques
  to optimize the architecture. Comprehensive ablation studies highlight the critical
  role of individual components and training strategies, and in particular emphasize
  the importance of adapted attention mechanisms within the CNN framework to improve
  the model's focus on age-relevant facial features. The results show that the ConvNeXt-ViT
  hybrid not only outperforms traditional methods, but also provides a robust foundation
  for future advances in age estimation and related visual tasks. This work underscores
  the transformative potential of hybrid architectures and represents a promising
  direction for the seamless integration of CNNs and transformers to address complex
  computer vision challenges.
