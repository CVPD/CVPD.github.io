 abstract = {The Drosophila brain is formed by an invariant set of lineages, each
of which is derived from a unique neural stem cell (neuroblast) and
forms a genetic and structural unit of the brain. The task of reconstructing
brain circuitry at the level of individual neurons can be made significantly
easier by assigning neurons to their respective lineages. In this
article we address the automation of neuron and lineage identification.
We focused on the Drosophila brain lineages at the larval stage when
they form easily recognizable secondary axon tracts (SATs) that were
previously partially characterized. We now generated an annotated
digital database containing all lineage tracts reconstructed from
five registered wild-type brains, at higher resolution and including
some that were previously not characterized. We developed a method
for SAT structural comparisons based on a dynamic programming approach
akin to nucleotide sequence alignment and a machine learning classifier
trained on the annotated database of reference SATs. We quantified
the stereotypy of SATs by measuring the residual variability of aligned
wild-type SATs. Next, we used our method for the identification of
SATs within wild-type larval brains, and found it highly accurate
(93-99%). The method proved highly robust for the identification
of lineages in mutant brains and in brains that differed in developmental
time or labeling. We describe for the first time an algorithm that
quantifies neuronal projection stereotypy in the Drosophila brain
and use the algorithm for automatic neuron and lineage recognition.},
