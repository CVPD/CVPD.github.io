abstract: The Drosophila brain is formed by an invariant set of lineages, each of
  which is derived from a unique neural stem cell (neuroblast) and forms a genetic
  and structural unit of the brain. The task of reconstructing brain circuitry at
  the level of individual neurons can be made significantly easier by assigning neurons
  to their respective lineages. In this article we address the automation of neuron
  and lineage identification. We focused on the Drosophila brain lineages at the larval
  stage when they form easily recognizable secondary axon tracts (SATs) that were
  previously partially characterized. We now generated an annotated digital database
  containing all lineage tracts reconstructed from five registered wild-type brains,
  at higher resolution and including some that were previously not characterized.
  We developed a method for SAT structural comparisons based on a dynamic programming
  approach akin to nucleotide sequence alignment and a machine learning classifier
  trained on the annotated database of reference SATs. We quantified the stereotypy
  of SATs by measuring the residual variability of aligned wild-type SATs. Next, we
  used our method for the identification of SATs within wild-type larval brains, and
  found it highly accurate (93-99%). The method proved highly robust for the identification
  of lineages in mutant brains and in brains that differed in developmental time or
  labeling. We describe for the first time an algorithm that quantifies neuronal projection
  stereotypy in the Drosophila brain and use the algorithm for automatic neuron and
  lineage recognition.
