abstract: Eye blink detection is a challenging problem that many researchers are working
  on because it has the potential to solve many facial analysis tasks, such as face
  anti-spoofing, driver drowsiness detection, and some health disorders. There have
  been few attempts to detect blinking in the wild scenario, while most of the work
  has been done under controlled conditions. Moreover, current learning approaches
  are designed to process sequences that contain only a single blink ignoring the
  case of the presence of multiple eye blinks. In this work, we propose a fast framework
  for eye blink detection and eye blink verification that can effectively extract
  multiple blinks from image sequences considering several challenges such as lighting
  changes, variety of poses, and change in appearance. The proposed framework employs
  fast landmarks detector to extract multiple facial key points including the ones
  that identify the eye regions. Then, an SVD-based method is proposed to extract
  the potential eye blinks in a moving time window that is updated with new images
  every second. Finally, the detected blink candidates are verified using a 2D Pyramidal
  Bottleneck Block Network (PBBN). We also propose an alternative approach that uses
  a sequence of frames instead of an image as input and employs a continuous 3D PBBN
  that follows most of the state-of-the-art approaches schemes. Experimental results
  show the better performance of the proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art
  approaches.
