abstract: The recent advances in mobile robot surveillance have significantly enhanced
  supervision tasks. Unlike traditional CCTV systems, these robots improve patrolling
  capabilities, ensuring higher area coverage for situational awareness. Leveraging
  AI and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), these robots demonstrate enhanced visual
  perception for situational awareness. However, the complexity of deploying multiple,
  task-specific CNNs poses significant computational challenges, especially due to
  the robots’ limited hardware capacity. Additionally, defining an optimal supervision
  strategy is challenging. While existing literature faces these challenges through
  anomaly and scene change detection (SCD), this paper proposes a novel visual perception
  methodology for executing at the edge hardware. This approach defines an optimal
  scheduling method for detecting unauthorized human and vehicle access, potential
  physical access threat analysis, and scene change detection (SCD). Experimental
  results validate the methodology’s effectiveness in improving preventive security
  in restricted zones.
