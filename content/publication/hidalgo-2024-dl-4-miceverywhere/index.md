abstract: DL4MicEverywhere is a platform that lets users train and implement their
  models in different computational environments. These environments include Google
  Colab, personal computational resources such as a desktop or laptop, and HPC systems.
  This flexibility is achieved by encapsulating each deep learning technique in an
  interactive Jupyter Notebook within a Docker container, enabling others to replicate
  analyses consistently across multiple platforms. DL4MicEverywhere (https://github.com/HenriquesLab/DL4MicEverywhere)
  enables users to install and interact with a large offering of standardized, user-friendly
  deep learning workflows, away from the limitations of proprietary platforms such
  as Google Colab and in a secure computational environment with controlled data privacy
  and resources. DL4MicEverywhere can be launched graphically, via X11 forwarding,
  or directly through a command line (headless mode), supporting HPC usage. This cross-platform
  containerization technology boosts the long-term platform’s sustainability and reproducibility,
  enhancing user convenience.
