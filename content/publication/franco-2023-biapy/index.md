abstract: In recent years, technological advances in microscopy have made available
  large amounts of data to biomedical researchers in the form of images. By learning
  from such large datasets, deep learning-based methods have successfully addressed
  previously inaccessible bioimage analysis tasks. However, most available solutions
  target a particular subset of problems, forcing users to be familiarized with different
  applications to complete their data analysis. On top of that, other issues, such
  as reproducibility, lack of documentation, or access to the code, arise. For these
  reasons, we introduce BiaPy, an open-source ready-to-use all-in-one library that
  provides deep-learning workflows for a large variety of bioimage analysis tasks,
  including 2D and 3D semantic and instance segmentation, object detection, super-resolution,
  denoising, self-supervised learning, and classification. All code and documentation
  are publicly available at https://github.com/danifranco/BiaPy.
