abstract: Cancer cell invasion through tissue barriers is the intrinsic feature of
  metastasis, the most life-threatening aspect of cancer. Detailed observation and
  analysis of cancer cell behaviour in a 3D environment is essential for a full understanding
  of the mechanisms of cancer cell invasion. The inherent limits of optical microscopy
  resolution do not allow to for in-depth observation of intracellular structures,
  such as invadopodia of invading cancer cells. The required resolution can be achieved
  using electron microscopy techniques such as FIB-SEM. However, visualising cells
  in a 3D matrix using FIB-SEM is challenging due to difficulties with localisation
  of a specific cell deep within the resin block. We have developed a new protocol
  based on the near-infrared branding (NIRB) procedure that extends the pattern from
  the surface grid deep inside the resin. This 3D burned pattern allows for precise
  trimming followed by targeted 3D FIB-SEM. Here we present detailed 3D CLEM results
  combining confocal and FIB-SEM imaging of cancer cell invadopodia that extend deep
  into the collagen meshwork.
