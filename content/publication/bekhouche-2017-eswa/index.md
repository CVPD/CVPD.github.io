abstract: 'We present a novel learning system for human demographic estimation in
  which the ethnicity, gender and age attributes are estimated from facial images.
  The proposed approach consists of the following three main stages: 1) face alignment
  and preprocessing; 2) constructing a Pyramid Multi-Level face representation from
  which the local features are extracted from the blocks of the whole pyramid; 3)
  feeding the obtained features to an hierarchical estimator having three layers.
  Due to the fact that ethnicity is by far the easiest attribute to estimate, the
  adopted hierarchy is as follows. The first layer predicts ethnicity of the input
  face. Based on that prediction, the second layer estimates the gender using the
  corresponding gender classifier. Based on the predicted ethnicity and gender, the
  age is finally estimated using the corresponding regressor. Experiments are conducted
  on five public databases (MORPH II, PAL, IoG, LFW and FERET) and another two challenge
  databases (Apparent age; Smile and Gender) of the 2016 ChaLearn Looking at People
  and Faces of the World Challenge and Workshop. These experiments show stable and
  good results. We present many comparisons against state-of-the-art methods. We also
  provide a study about cross-database evaluation. We quantitatively measure the performance
  drop in age estimation and in gender classification when the ethnicity attribute
  is misclassified.'
