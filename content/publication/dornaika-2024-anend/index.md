abstract: Clustering data from different sources or views is a key challenge in real-world
  applications. While traditional graph-based methods are effective at capturing data
  structures, they often require separate steps to estimate graphs of views or a consensus
  graph from the raw data. This reliance on intermediate steps can make these clustering
  methods susceptible to noisy graphs, which affects the overall performance of clustering.
  In response to this limitation, and with an emphasis on advocating end-to-end solutions
  for multi-view clustering, two comprehensive approaches are presented in this paper.
  Each approach starts from either the raw data or its kernelized features. The first
  proposal introduces a unified objective function that enables the simultaneous recovery
  of the graph for each view, the unified graph, the spectral projection matrices
  for all views, the soft cluster assignments, and the scores assigned to each view.
  The second proposal uses a global criterion that integrates regularization and constraints
  for the soft cluster assignment matrix based on the consensus graph matrix and the
  consensus data representation. Both proposed methods enable direct and straightforward
  clustering of the data without the need for additional steps. Extensive tests with
  various real-world image and text datasets confirm the superior performance of the
  two proposed methods.
