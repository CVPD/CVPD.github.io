abstract: Cellular phenotypic heterogeneity is an important hallmark of many biological
  processes and understanding its origins remains a substantial challenge. This heterogeneity
  often reflects variations in the chromatin structure, influenced by factors such
  as viral infections and cancer, which dramatically reshape the cellular landscape.
  To address the challenge of identifying distinct cell states, we developed artificial
  intelligence of the nucleus (AINU), a deep learning method that can identify specific
  nuclear signatures at the nanoscale resolution. AINU can distinguish different cell
  states based on the spatial arrangement of core histone H3, RNA polymerase II or
  DNA from super-resolution microscopy images. With only a small number of images
  as the training data, AINU correctly identifies human somatic cells, human-induced
  pluripotent stem cells, very early stage infected cells transduced with DNA herpes
  simplex virus type 1 and even cancer cells after appropriate retraining. Finally,
  using AI interpretability methods, we find that the RNA polymerase II localizations
  in the nucleoli aid in distinguishing human-induced pluripotent stem cells from
  their somatic cells. Overall, AINU coupled with super-resolution microscopy of nuclear
  structures provides a robust tool for the precise detection of cellular heterogeneity,
  with considerable potential for advancing diagnostics and therapies in regenerative
  medicine, virology and cancer biology.
