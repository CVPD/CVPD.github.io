abstract: Decades of research have not yet fully explained the mechanisms of epithelial
  self-organization and 3D packing. Single-cell analysis of large 3D epithelial libraries
  is crucial for understanding the assembly and function of whole tissues. Combining
  3D epithelial imaging with advanced deep-learning segmentation methods is essential
  for enabling this high-content analysis. We introduce CartoCell, a deep-learning-based
  pipeline that uses small datasets to generate accurate labels for hundreds of whole
  3D epithelial cysts. Our method detects the realistic morphology of epithelial cells
  and their contacts in the 3D structure of the tissue. CartoCell enables the quantification
  of geometric and packing features at the cellular level. Our single-cell cartography
  approach then maps the distribution of these features on 2D plots and 3D surface
  maps, revealing cell morphology patterns in epithelial cysts. Additionally, we show
  that CartoCell can be adapted to other types of epithelial tissues.
