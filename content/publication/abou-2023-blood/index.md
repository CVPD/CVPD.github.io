abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a cutting-edge tool, simultaneously
  accelerating, securing, and enhancing the diagnosis and treatment of patients. An
  exemplification of this capability is evident in the analysis of peripheral blood
  smears (PBS). In university medical centers, hematologists routinely examine hundreds
  of PBS slides daily to validate or correct outcomes produced by advanced hematology
  analyzers assessing samples from potentially problematic patients. This process
  may logically lead to erroneous PBC readings, posing risks to patient health. AI
  functions as a transformative tool, significantly improving the accuracy and precision
  of readings and diagnoses. This study reshapes the parameters of blood cell classification,
  harnessing the capabilities of AI and broadening the scope from 5 to 11 specific
  blood cell categories with the challenging 11-class PBC dataset. This transformation
  facilitates a more profound exploration of blood cell diversity, surpassing prior
  constraints in medical image analysis. Our approach combines state-of-the-art deep
  learning techniques, including pre-trained ConvNets, ViTb16 models, and custom CNN
  architectures. We employ transfer learning, fine-tuning, and ensemble strategies,
  such as CBAM and Averaging ensembles, to achieve unprecedented accuracy and interpretability.
  Our fully fine-tuned EfficientNetV2 B0 model sets a new standard, with a macro-average
  precision, recall, and F1-score of 91%, 90%, and 90%, respectively, and an average
  accuracy of 93%. This breakthrough underscores the transformative potential of 11-class
  blood cell classification for more precise medical diagnoses. Moreover, our groundbreaking
  “Naturalize” augmentation technique produces remarkable results. The 2K-PBC dataset
  generated with “Naturalize” boasts a macro-average precision, recall, and F1-score
  of 97%, along with an average accuracy of 96% when leveraging the fully fine-tuned
  EfficientNetV2 B0 model. This innovation not only elevates classification performance
  but also addresses data scarcity and bias in medical deep learning. Our research
  marks a paradigm shift in blood cell classification, enabling more nuanced and insightful
  medical analyses. The “Naturalize” technique’s impact extends beyond blood cell
  classification, emphasizing the vital role of diverse and comprehensive datasets
  in advancing healthcare applications through deep learning.
