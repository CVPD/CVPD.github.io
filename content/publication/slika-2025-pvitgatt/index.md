abstract: 'The development of a robust and adaptive deep learning technique for the
  diagnosis of pneumonia and the assessment of its severity was a major challenge.
  Indeed, both chest X-rays (CXR) and CT scans have been widely studied for the diagnosis,
  detection and quantification of pneumonia. In this paper, a novel approach (PViTGAtt-IP)
  based on a parallel array of vision transformers is presented, in which the input
  image is divided into regions of interest. Each region is fed into an individual
  model and the collective output gives the severity score. Three parallel architectures
  were also derived and tested. The proposed models were subjected to rigorous tests
  on two different datasets: RALO CXRs and Per COVID-19 CT scans. The experimental
  results showed that the proposed models exhibited high performance in accurately
  predicting scores for both datasets. In particular, the parallel transformers with
  multi-gate attention proved to be the best performing model. Furthermore, a comparative
  analysis using state-of-the-art methods showed that our proposed approach consistently
  achieved competitive or even better performance in terms of the Mean Absolute Error
  (MAE) and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PC). This emphasizes the effectiveness
  and superiority of our models in the context of diagnosing and assessing the severity
  of pneumonia. The source codes used in our study are publicly available and can
