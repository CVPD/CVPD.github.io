abstract: 'Background: In response to the escalating global concerns surrounding skin
  cancer, this study aims to address the imperative for precise and efficient diagnostic
  methodologies. Focusing on the intricate task of eight-class skin cancer classification,
  the research delves into the limitations of conventional diagnostic approaches,
  often hindered by subjectivity and resource constraints. The transformative potential
  of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in revolutionizing diagnostic paradigms is underscored,
  emphasizing significant improvements in accuracy and accessibility. Methods: Utilizing
  cutting-edge deep learning models on the ISIC2019 dataset, a comprehensive analysis
  is conducted, employing a diverse array of pre-trained ImageNet architectures and
  Vision Transformer models. To counteract the inherent class imbalance in skin cancer
  datasets, a pioneering “Naturalize” augmentation technique is introduced. This technique
  leads to the creation of two indispensable datasets—the Naturalized 2.4K ISIC2019
  and groundbreaking Naturalized 7.2K ISIC2019 datasets—catalyzing advancements in
  classification accuracy. The “Naturalize” augmentation technique involves the segmentation
  of skin cancer images using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and the systematic
  addition of segmented cancer images to a background image to generate new composite
  images. Results: The research showcases the pivotal role of AI in mitigating the
  risks of misdiagnosis and under-diagnosis in skin cancer. The proficiency of AI
  in analyzing vast datasets and discerning subtle patterns significantly augments
  the diagnostic prowess of dermatologists. Quantitative measures such as confusion
  matrices, classification reports, and visual analyses using Score-CAM across diverse
  dataset variations are meticulously evaluated. The culmination of these endeavors
  resulted in an unprecedented achievement—100% average accuracy, precision, recall,
  and F1-score—within the groundbreaking Naturalized 7.2K ISIC2019 dataset. Conclusion:
  This groundbreaking exploration highlights the transformative capabilities of AI-driven
  methodologies in reshaping the landscape of skin cancer diagnosis and patient care.
  The research represents a pivotal stride towards redefining dermatological diagnosis,
  showcasing the remarkable impact of AI-powered solutions in surmounting the challenges
  inherent in skin cancer diagnosis. The attainment of 100% across crucial metrics
  within the Naturalized 7.2K ISIC2019 dataset serves as a testament to the transformative
  capabilities of AI-driven approaches in reshaping the trajectory of skin cancer
  diagnosis and patient care. This pioneering work paves the way for a new era in
  dermatological diagnostics, heralding the dawn of unprecedented precision and efficacy
  in the identification and classification of skin cancers.'
