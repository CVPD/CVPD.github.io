 abstract = {When considering a large dataset of histopathologic breast images captured at various magnification levels, the process of distinguishing between benign and malignant cancer from these images can be time-intensive. The automation of histopathological breast cancer image classification holds significant promise for expediting pathology diagnoses and reducing the analysis time. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently gained traction for their ability to more accurately classify histopathological breast cancer images. CNNs excel at extracting distinctive features that emphasize semantic information. However, traditional CNNs employing the softmax loss function often struggle to achieve the necessary discriminatory power for this task. To address this challenge, a set of angular margin-based softmax loss functions have emerged, including angular softmax (A-Softmax), large margin cosine loss (CosFace), and additive angular margin (ArcFace), each sharing a common objective: maximizing inter-class variation while minimizing intra-class variation. This study delves into these three loss functions and their potential to extract distinguishing features while expanding the decision boundary between classes. Rigorous experimentation on a well-established histopathological breast cancer image dataset, BreakHis, has been conducted. As per the results, it is evident that CosFace focuses on augmenting the differences between classes, while A-Softmax and ArcFace tend to emphasize augmenting within-class variations. These observations underscore the efficacy of margin penalties on angular softmax losses in enhancing feature discrimination within the embedding space. These loss functions consistently outperform softmax-based techniques, either by widening the gaps among classes or enhancing the compactness of individual classes.},
