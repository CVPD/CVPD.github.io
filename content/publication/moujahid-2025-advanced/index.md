abstract: 'Machine learning techniques face numerous challenges to achieve optimal
  performance. These include computational constraints, the limitations of single-view
  learning algorithms and the complexity of processing large datasets from different
  domains, sources or views. In this context, multi-view clustering (MVC), a class
  of unsupervised multi-view learning, emerges as a powerful approach to overcome
  these challenges. MVC compensates for the shortcomings of single-view methods and
  provides a richer data representation and effective solutions for a variety of unsupervised
  learning tasks. In contrast to traditional single-view approaches, the semantically
  rich nature of multi-view data increases its practical utility despite its inherent
  complexity. This survey makes a threefold contribution: (1) a systematic categorization
  of multi-view clustering methods into well-defined groups, including co-training,
  co-regularization, subspace, deep learning, kernel-based, anchor-based, and graph-based
  strategies; (2) an in-depth analysis of their respective strengths, weaknesses,
  and practical challenges, such as scalability and incomplete data; and (3) a forward-looking
  discussion of emerging trends, interdisciplinary applications, and future directions
  in MVC research. This study represents an extensive workload, encompassing the review
  of over 140 foundational and recent publications, the development of comparative
  insights on integration strategies such as early fusion, late fusion, and joint
  learning, and the structured investigation of practical use cases in the areas of
  healthcare, multimedia, and social network analysis. By integrating these efforts,
  this work aims to fill existing gaps in MVC research and provide actionable insights
  for the advancement of the field.'
