abstract: The development of autonomous driving systems heavily relies on high-quality
  LiDAR data, which is essential for robust object detection and scene understanding.
  Nevertheless, obtaining a substantial amount of such data for effective training
  and evaluation of autonomous driving algorithms is a major challenge. To overcome
  this limitation, recent studies are taking advantage of advancements in realistic
  simulation engines, such as CARLA, which have provided a breakthrough in generating
  synthetic LiDAR data that closely resembles realworld scenarios. However, these
  data are far from being identical to real data. In this study, we address the domain
  gap between real LiDAR data and synthetic data. We train deep-learning models for
  object detection using real data. Then, those models are rigorously evaluated using
  synthetic data generated in CARLA. By quantifying the discrepancies between the
  model's performance on real and synthetic data, the present study shows that there
  is indeed a domain gap between the two types of data and does not affect equal to
  different model architectures. Finally, we propose a method for synthetic data processing
  to reduce this domain gap. This research contributes to enhancing the use of synthetic
  data for autonomous driving systems.
