abstract: 'Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL) has garnered significant
  interest in the realms of machine learning and pattern recognition. Although some
  of the proposed methods have made some progress, there are still some shortcomings
  that need to be overcome. There are three main limitations. First, the graphs used
  in these approaches are usually predefined regardless of the task at hand. Second,
  due to the use of graphs, almost all approaches are unable to process and consider
  data with a very large number of unlabeled samples. Thirdly, the imbalance of the
  topology of the samples is very often not taken into account. In particular, processing
  large datasets with GSSL might pose challenges in terms of computational resource
  feasibility. In this article, we present a scalable and inductive GSSL method. We
  broaden the scope of the graph topology imbalance paradigm to extensive databases.
  Second, we employ the calculated weights of the labeled sample for the label-matching
  term in the global objective function. This leads to a unified, scalable, semi-supervised
  learning model that allows simultaneous labeling of unlabeled data, projection of
  the feature space onto the labeling space, along with the graph matrix of anchors.
  In the proposed scheme, the integration of labels and features from anchors is applied
  for the adaptive construction of the anchor graph. Experimental results were performed
  on four large databases: NORB, RCV1, Covtype, and MNIST. These experiments demonstrate
  that the proposed method exhibits superior performance when compared to existing
  scalable semi-supervised learning models.'
