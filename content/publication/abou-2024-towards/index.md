abstract: The exceptional performance of ImageNet competition winners in image classification
  has led AI researchers to repurpose these models for a whole range of tasks using
  transfer learning (TL). TL has been hailed for boosting performance, shortening
  learning time and reducing computational effort. Despite these benefits, issues
  such as data sparsity and the misrepresentation of classes can diminish these gains,
  occasionally leading to misleading TL accuracy scores. This research explores the
  innovative concept of endowing ImageNet models with a self-awareness that enables
  them to recognize their own accumulated knowledge and experience. Such self-awareness
  is expected to improve their adaptability in various domains. We conduct a case
  study using two different datasets, PBC and BCCD, which focus on blood cell classification.
  The PBC dataset provides high-resolution images with abundant data, while the BCCD
  dataset is hindered by limited data and inferior image quality. To compensate for
  these discrepancies, we use data augmentation for BCCD and undersampling for both
  datasets to achieve balance. Subsequent pre-processing generates datasets of different
  size and quality, all geared towards blood cell classification. We extend conventional
  evaluation tools with novel metrics—“accuracy difference” and “loss difference”—to
  detect overfitting or underfitting and evaluate their utility as potential indicators
  for learning behavior and promoting the self-confidence of ImageNet models. Our
  results show that these metrics effectively track learning progress and improve
  the reliability and overall performance of ImageNet models in new applications.
  This study highlights the transformative potential of turning ImageNet models into
  self-aware entities that significantly improve their robustness and efficiency in
  various AI tasks. This groundbreaking approach opens new perspectives for increasing
  the effectiveness of transfer learning in real-world AI implementations.
