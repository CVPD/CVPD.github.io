abstract: Behavior modeling has multiple applications in the intelligent environment
  domain. It has been used in different tasks, such as the stratification of different
  pathologies, prediction of the user actions and activities, or modeling the energy
  usage. Specifically, behavior prediction can be used to forecast the future evolution
  of the users and to identify those behaviors that deviate from the expected conduct.
  In this paper, we propose the use of embeddings to represent the user actions, and
  study and compare several behavior prediction approaches. We test multiple model
  (LSTM, CNNs, GCNs, and transformers) architectures to ascertain the best approach
  to using embeddings for behavior modeling and also evaluate multiple embedding retrofitting
  approaches. To do so, we use the Kasteren dataset for intelligent environments,
  which is one of the most widely used datasets in the areas of activity recognition
  and behavior modeling.
