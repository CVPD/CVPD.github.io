abstract: 'Multi-view clustering has attracted much attention recently. Among all
  clustering approaches, spectral ones have gained much popularity thanks to an elaborated
  and solid theoretical foundation. A major limitation of spectral clustering based
  methods is that these methods only provide a non-linear projection of the data,
  to which an additional step of clustering is required. This can degrade the quality
  of the final clustering due to various factors such as the initialization process
  or outliers. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a constrained version
  of a recent method called Multiview Spectral Clustering via integrating Nonnegative
  Embedding and Spectral Embedding. Besides retaining the advantages of this method,
  our proposed model integrates two types of constraints: (i) a consistent smoothness
  of the nonnegative embedding over all views and (ii) an orthogonality constraint
  over the columns of the nonnegative embedding. Experimental results on several real
  datasets show the superiority of the proposed approach.'
