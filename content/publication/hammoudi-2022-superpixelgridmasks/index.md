abstract: A novel approach of data augmentation based on irregular superpixel decomposition
  is proposed. This approach called SuperpixelGridMasks permits to extend original
  image datasets that are required by training stages of machine learning-related
  analysis architectures towards increasing their performances. Three variants named
  SuperpixelGridCut, SuperpixelGridMean, and SuperpixelGridMix are presented. These
  grid-based methods produce a new style of image transformations using the dropping
  and fusing of information. Extensive experiments using various image classification
  models as well as precision health and surrounding real-world datasets show that
  baseline performances can be significantly outperformed using our methods. The comparative
  study also shows that our methods can overpass the performances of other data augmentations.
  SuperpixelGridCut, SuperpixelGridMean, and SuperpixelGridMix codes are publicly
  available at https://github.com/hammoudiproject/SuperpixelGridMasks.
