abstract: Current methods used to quantify brain size and compartmental scaling relationships
  in studies of social insect brain evolution involve manual annotations of images
  from histological samples, confocal microscopy or other sources. This process is
  susceptible to human bias and error and requires time-consuming effort by expert
  annotators. Standardized brain atlases, constructed through 3D registration and
  automatic segmentation, surmount these issues while increasing throughput to robustly
  sample diverse morphological and behavioral phenotypes. Here we design and evaluate
  three strategies to construct statistical brain atlases, or templates, using ants
  as a model taxon. The first technique creates a template by registering multiple
  brains of the same species. Brain regions are manually annotated on the template,
  and the labels are transformed back to each individual brain to obtain an automatic
  annotation, or to any other brain aligned with the template. The second strategy
  also creates a template from multiple brain images but obtains labels as a consensus
  from multiple manual annotations of individual brains comprising the template. The
  third technique is based on a template comprising brains from multiple species and
  the consensus of their labels. We used volume similarity as a metric to evaluate
  the automatic segmentation produced by each method against the inter- and intra-individual
  variability of human expert annotators. We found that automatic and manual methods
  are equivalent in volume accuracy, making the template technique an extraordinary
  tool to accelerate data collection and reduce human bias in the study of the evolutionary
  neurobiology of ants and other insects.
