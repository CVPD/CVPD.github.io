abstract: Falls pose a major threat for the elderly as they result in severe consequences
  for their physical and mental health or even death in the worst-case scenario. Nonetheless,
  the impact of falls can be alleviated with appropriate technological solutions.
  Fall detection is the task of recognising a fall, i.e. detecting when a person has
  fallen in a video. Such an algorithm can be implemented in lightweight devices which
  can then cater to the users’ needs, e.g. alerting emergency services or caregivers.
  At the core of those systems, a model capable of promptly recognising falls is crucial
  for reducing the time until help comes. In this paper we propose a fall detection
  solution based on transformers, i.e. state-of-the-art neural networks for computer
  vision tasks. Our model takes a video clip and decides if a fall has occurred or
  not. In a video stream, it would be applied in a sliding-window fashion to trigger
  an alarm as soon as it detects a fall. We evaluate our fall detection backbone model
  on the large UP-Fall dataset, as well as on the UR fall dataset, and compare our
  results with existing literature using the former dataset.
