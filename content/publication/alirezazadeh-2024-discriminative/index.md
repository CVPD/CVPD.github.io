abstract: ' When many histopathological breast images with different magnification
  levels need to be analyzed, diagnosing benign or malignant cancer from the images
  can be time-consuming. Automatic classification of histopathological images of breast
  cancer can support the diagnostic workflow in pathology, reducing analysis time.
  Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used for more accurate
  classification of breast cancer histopathological images. CNNs typically highlight
  semantic information to extract discriminative features. However, the traditional
  softmax loss used by CNNs usually lacks sufficient discriminative power. To address
  this problem, several angular margin-based softmax loss functions have been proposed,
  including Large Margin Softmax Loss (A-Softmax), Large Margin Cosine Loss (CosFace),
  Additive Angular Margin Loss (ArcFace), and Linear ArcFace (Li-ArcFace). All of
  these improved losses are based on the same concept: maximizing inter-class variance
  while minimizing intra-class distance. This paper focuses on these four losses and
  their effectiveness in extracting discriminative features and creating decision
  margins between classes. Extensive experimental evaluations were conducted on a
  public and well-known histopathological breast cancer image dataset (BreakHis).
  Further experiments with the BACH dataset for breast cancer classification and the
  SARS-CoV-2 CT-scan dataset for COVID-19 detection affirm the generalization capability
  of angular margin-based softmax losses in medical image classification.'
