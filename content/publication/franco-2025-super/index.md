abstract: Fluorescence microscopy faces challenges in resolution, phototoxicity, and
  anisotropic artifacts. The Fuse My Cells challenge, organized by France-BioImaging,
  aims to develop deep learning models that predict fused 3D volumes from single-view
  acquisitions, reducing phototoxic exposure while enhancing resolution. In this work,
  we benchmark state-of-the-art super-resolution models, including DFCAN, RCAN-3D,
  UNETR, and a 3D-adapted RCAN-it, evaluating their performance on the Fuse My Cells
  challenge dataset, which encompasses 802 3D light-sheet microscopy images. A novel
  training strategy prioritizing high-discrepancy regions optimizes efficiency and
  improves reconstruction accuracy. Our findings suggest that super-resolution models
  can not fully reconstruct the information on those image areas with minimum signal
  information. Code and documentation can be found at https://github.com/danifranco/BiaPy.
