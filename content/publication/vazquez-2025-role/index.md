abstract: 'The aim of this systematic review was to comprehensively analyse recent
  studies on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in dental implantology.
  The PRISMA guidelines were followed. Five databases were accessed: Scopus, Web of
  Science, MEDLINE/PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and JSTOR. Documents published between 2018
  and October 15, 2024 relating to AI and implantology were considered. Exclusions
  encompassed reviews, opinion articles, books, conference references, studies using
  AI as a supplementary method, AI for teaching implant dentistry, and AI for implant
  fabrication, prothesis, or design. A total of 120 relevant papers were included.
  Risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST. Findings demonstrated extensive utilization
  of AI in various aspects of dental implantology: guided surgery, diagnosis, classification
  of oral structures, bone classification, classification of dental restorations,
  implant classification, implant planning, and implant prognosis. Deep learning algorithms
  were employed in 89.2% of studies, predominantly utilizing image data (72.0% two-dimensional
  images and 28.0% three-dimensional images). Publications doubled in 2022 compared
  to the previous year and have remained consistent since. Despite growth, the field
  remains relatively underdeveloped. However, with advancements in technology and
  data quality, substantial progress is anticipated in forthcoming years. Remarkably,
  11 studies were found to have a high risk of bias.'
