abstract: This paper focuses on graph-based semi-supervised learning, specifically
  for large-scale graphs used in inductive multi-class classification. The proposed
  method aims to overcome limitations in current scalable graph-based semi-supervised
  learning techniques. The key innovation is integrating the anchor graph calculation
  into the learning model, rather than treating it as a separate, offline step. This
  approach involves several essential tasks, including simultaneously estimating unlabeled
  samples, mapping the feature space to the label space, creating an affinity matrix
  for the anchor graph, and using labels and features associated with anchor points
  to construct the graph. The experimental results, conducted with large datasets,
  demonstrate a positive trend, showing higher accuracy and greater stability compared
  to existing scalable graph-based semi-supervised learning methods.
