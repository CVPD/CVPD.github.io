abstract: Segmentation of medical images is crucial for accu-rate diagnosis, treatment
  planning and intervention. However, the scarcity of data and the variability of
  different imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, PET and ultrasound, pose a major
  challenge for deep learning models. This review discusses traditional and advanced
  data augmentation techniques used to improve segmentation performance. In addition
  to geometric transformations such as rotation and scaling, advanced approaches such
  as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and superpixel-based augmentations are
  also evaluated. The review also highlights novel methods such as Local-and-Contour
  Aware Grid Mixing (LCAMix) and Hard and Soft Mixing (HSMix) that preserve anatomical
  boundaries and effectively augment datasets. The analysis concludes with practical
  insights for clinical applications and suggests integrating these techniques into
  data pipelines to increase the generalizability of models. Future research directions
  focus on DICOM-specific augmentation strategies and optimization of computational
  requirements to improve clinical applicability.
