abstract: Respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19, pose a significant health challenge.
  The prompt and precise identification of pulmonary infections is essential for recognizing
  patients and deciding on suitable life-saving interventions. In our research, we
  introduce a multi-task deep learning algorithm crafted to swiftly and effectively
  evaluate the severity of pulmonary infections in individuals afflicted with COVID-19
  or analogous respiratory ailments. Our key contributions entail suggesting a multi-task
  network utilizing a dual transformer encoder, accompanied by a feature fusion module
  that feeds two MLP regression heads. Additionally, an online amalgamation of region
  and score for image augmentation is employed. The consequent model quantifies chest
  radiographs (CXR) with two scores, characterizing the extent and opacity of infection
  in the lungs. Evaluation on the RALO dataset demonstrates that our multi-task approach
  outperforms existing prediction models, exhibiting the minimum mean absolute error
  and the maximum Pearson correlation coefficient during inference. These results
  emphasize the effectiveness of inducing two estimation scores in a multi-tasking
  approach for accurate lung severity diagnosis. The source code is publicly accessible
