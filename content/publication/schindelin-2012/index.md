abstract: Fiji is a distribution of the popular open-source software ImageJ focused
  on biological-image analysis. Fiji uses modern software engineering practices to
  combine powerful software libraries with a broad range of scripting languages to
  enable rapid prototyping of image-processing algorithms. Fiji facilitates the transformation
  of new algorithms into ImageJ plugins that can be shared with end users through
  an integrated update system. We propose Fiji as a platform for productive collaboration
  between computer science and biology research communities.
