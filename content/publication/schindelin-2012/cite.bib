 abstract = {Fiji is a distribution of the popular open-source software ImageJ
focused on biological-image analysis. Fiji uses modern software engineering
practices to combine powerful software libraries with a broad range
of scripting languages to enable rapid prototyping of image-processing
algorithms. Fiji facilitates the transformation of new algorithms
into ImageJ plugins that can be shared with end users through an
integrated update system. We propose Fiji as a platform for productive
collaboration between computer science and biology research communities.},
