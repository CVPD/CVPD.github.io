abstract: Over the last decade, the world has witnessed many breakthroughs in artificial
  intelligence, largely due to advances in deep learning technology. Notably, computer
  vision solutions have significantly contributed to these achievements. Human face
  analysis, a core area of computer vision, has gained considerable attention due
  to its wide applicability in fields such as law enforcement, social media, and marketing.
  However, existing methods for facial age estimation often struggle with accuracy
  due to limited feature extraction capabilities and inefficiencies in learning hierarchical
  representations. This paper introduces a novel framework to address these issues
  by proposing a Multi-Stage Deep Neural Network (MSDNN) architecture. The MSDNN architecture
  divides each CNN backbone into multiple stages, enabling more comprehensive feature
  extraction, thereby improving the accuracy of age predictions from facial images.
  Our framework demonstrates a significant performance improvement over traditional
  solutions, with its effectiveness validated through comparisons with the EfficientNet
  and MobileNetV3 architectures. The proposed MSDNN architecture achieves a notable
  decrease in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) across three widely used public datasets (MORPH2,
  CACD, and AFAD) while maintaining a virtually identical parameter count compared
  to the initial backbone architectures. These results underscore the effectiveness
  and feasibility of our methodology in advancing the field of age estimation, showcasing
  it as a robust solution for enhancing the accuracy of age prediction algorithms.
