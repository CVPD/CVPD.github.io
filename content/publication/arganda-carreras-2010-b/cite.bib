 abstract = {We present a novel algorithm for the registration of 2D image sequences
that combines the principles of multiresolution B-spline-based elastic
registration and those of bidirectional consistent registration.
In our method, consecutive triples of images are iteratively registered
to gradually extend the information through the set of images of
the entire sequence. The intermediate results are reused for the
registration of the following triple. We choose to interpolate the
images and model the deformation fields using B-spline multiresolution
pyramids. Novel boundary conditions are introduced to better characterize
the deformations at the boundaries. In the experimental section,
we quantitatively show that our method recovers from barrel/pincushion
and fish-eye deformations with subpixel error. Moreover, it is more
robust against outliers—occasional strong noise and large rotations—than
the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we show that our method can
be used to realign series of histological serial sections, which
are often heavily distorted due to folding and tearing of the tissues.},
