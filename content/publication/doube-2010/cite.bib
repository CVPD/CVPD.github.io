 abstract = {Bone geometry is commonly measured on computed tomographic (CT) and
X-ray microtomographic ([mu]CT) images. We obtained hundreds of CT,
[mu]CT and synchrotron [mu]CT images of bones from diverse species
that needed to be analysed remote from scanning hardware, but found
that available software solutions were expensive, inflexible or methodologically
opaque. We implemented standard bone measurements in a novel ImageJ
plugin, BoneJ, with which we analysed trabecular bone, whole bones
and osteocyte lacunae. BoneJ is open source and free for anyone to
download, use, modify and distribute.},
