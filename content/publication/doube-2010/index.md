abstract: Bone geometry is commonly measured on computed tomographic (CT) and X-ray
  microtomographic ([mu]CT) images. We obtained hundreds of CT, [mu]CT and synchrotron
  [mu]CT images of bones from diverse species that needed to be analysed remote from
  scanning hardware, but found that available software solutions were expensive, inflexible
  or methodologically opaque. We implemented standard bone measurements in a novel
  ImageJ plugin, BoneJ, with which we analysed trabecular bone, whole bones and osteocyte
  lacunae. BoneJ is open source and free for anyone to download, use, modify and distribute.
