abstract: 'Background: Sperm metabolic pathways that generate energy for motility
  are compartmentalized within the flagellum. Dysfunctions in metabolic compartments,
  namely mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis, can compromise motility and male
  fertility. Studying these compartments is thus required for fertility treatment.
  However, it is very challenging to capture images of metabolic compartments in motile
  spermatozoa because the fast beating of the flagellum introduces motion blur. Therefore,
  most approaches immobilize spermatozoa prior to imaging. Results: Our findings indicate
  that immobilizing sperm alters their metabolic profile, highlighting the necessity
  for measuring metabolism in spermatozoa during movement. We achieved this by encapsulating
  mouse epididymis in a hydrogel followed by two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging
  microscopy for imaging motile sperm in situ. The autofluorescence of endogenous
  metabolites—FAD, NADH, and NADPH—enabled us to visualize sperm metabolic compartments
  without staining. We trained machine learning for automated image segmentation and
  generated metabolic fingerprints using object-based phasor analysis. We show that
  metabolic fingerprints of spermatozoa and the mitochondrial compartment (1) can
  distinguish individual males by genetic background, age, or fecundity status, (2)
  correlate with fertility, and (3) change with age likely due to increased oxidative
  metabolism. Conclusions: Our approach eliminates the need for sperm immobilization
  and labeling and captures the native state of sperm metabolism. This technique could
  be adapted for metabolism-based sperm selection for assisted reproduction.'
