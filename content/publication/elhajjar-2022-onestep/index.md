abstract: Recently, one-step clustering methods have shown good performance. However,
  very few one-step approaches have addressed the multi-view case, where an instance
  may have multiple representations. Data can be represented with multiple heterogeneous
  views. Clustering with multiple views faces the challenge of how to combine all
  the different views. A general scheme is to represent the views by view-based graphs
  and/or a consensus graph. Graphs can be well suited for clustering problems since
  they can capture the local and global structure of the data. In this paper, we present
  a novel approach to one-step graph-based multi-view clustering. In contrast to existing
  graph-based one-step clustering methods, our proposed method introduces two key
  innovations. First, we build an additional graph by using the cluster label correlation
  to the graphs associated with the data space. Second, a smoothing constraint is
  exploited to constrain the cluster-label matrix and make it more consistent with
  the original data graphs as well as with and label graphs. Experimental results
  on several public datasets show the efficiency of the proposed approach. All cluster
  evaluation metrics show significant improvement by applying our method to different
  types and sizes of datasets. The average improvement (across all datasets) is the
  difference between the indicator obtained by our approach and the indicator obtained
  by the most competitive method. The average improvement is approximately 4%, 2%,
  3%, and 2% for the Accuracy indicator, the Normalized Mutual Information indicator,
  the Purity indicator, and the Adjusted Rand index, respectively.
