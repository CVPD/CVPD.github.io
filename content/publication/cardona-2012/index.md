abstract: <p>A key challenge in neuroscience is the expeditious reconstruction of
  neuronal circuits. For model systems such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C.
  elegans</italic>, the limiting step is no longer the acquisition of imagery but
  the extraction of the circuit from images. For this purpose, we designed a software
  application, TrakEM2, that addresses the systematic reconstruction of neuronal circuits
  from large electron microscopical and optical image volumes. We address the challenges
  of image volume composition from individual, deformed images; of the reconstruction
  of neuronal arbors and annotation of synapses with fast manual and semi-automatic
  methods; and the management of large collections of both images and annotations.
  The output is a neural circuit of 3d arbors and synapses, encoded in NeuroML and
  other formats, ready for analysis.</p>
