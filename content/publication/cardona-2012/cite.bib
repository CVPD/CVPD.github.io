 abstract = {<p>A key challenge in neuroscience is the expeditious reconstruction
of neuronal circuits. For model systems such as <italic>Drosophila</italic>
and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the limiting step is no longer the
acquisition of imagery but the extraction of the circuit from images.
For this purpose, we designed a software application, TrakEM2, that
addresses the systematic reconstruction of neuronal circuits from
large electron microscopical and optical image volumes. We address
the challenges of image volume composition from individual, deformed
images; of the reconstruction of neuronal arbors and annotation of
synapses with fast manual and semi-automatic methods; and the management
of large collections of both images and annotations. The output is
a neural circuit of 3d arbors and synapses, encoded in NeuroML and
other formats, ready for analysis.</p>},
