abstract: 'Automatic classification methods widely used for diagnosing and analyzing
  COVID-19 cases. These methods assume known labels and rely on a single view of the
  dataset. Given the prevalence of COVID-19 cases and the extensive volume of patient
  records lacking labels, this communication underscores our unique approachâ€”conducting
  the first study on COVID-19 case diagnosis in an unsupervised manner. Our work operates
  under the assumption of prior knowledge regarding the number of classes, such as
  COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal, in a case study. By adopting an unsupervised learning
  paradigm, we leverage the wealth of unlabeled data, reducing dependence on human
  experts for annotating numerous images. This paper introduces an enhanced version
  of a recent direct method where non-negative cluster indices and spectral embeddings
  are jointly estimated. Beyond the inherent advantages of this method, our proposed
  model introduces improvements through two additional types of constraints: (i) ensuring
  consistent smoothing of cluster labels across all views and (ii) imposing an orthogonality
  constraint on the matrix of cluster assignments. The efficacy of the proposed method
  is demonstrated using the public COVIDx dataset with three classes, showcasing promising
  results in categorizing radiographs. The proposed approach is tested on other public
  image datasets to assess its effectiveness.'
