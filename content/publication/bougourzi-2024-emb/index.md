abstract: 'One of the primary challenges in applying deep learning approaches to medical
  imaging is the limited availability of data due to various factors. These factors
  include concerns about data privacy and the requirement for expert radiologists
  to perform the time-consuming and labor-intensive task of labeling data, particularly
  for tasks such as segmentation. Consequently, there is a critical need to develop
  novel approaches for few-shot learning tasks in this domain. In this work, we propose
  a Novel CNN-Transformer Fusion scheme to segment Multi-classes pneumonia infection
  from limited CT-scans data. In total, there are three main contributions: (i) CNN-Transformer
  encoders fusion, which allows to extract and fuse richer features in the encoding
  phase, which contains: local, global and long-range dependencies features, (ii)
  Multi-Branches Skip Connection (MBSC) is proposed to extract and fuse richer features
  from the encoder features then integrate them into the decoder layers, where MBSC
  blocks extract higher-level features related to the finer details of different infection
  types, and (iii) a Multi-classes Boundary Aware Cross-Entropy (MBA-CE) Loss function
  is proposed to deal with fuzzy boundaries, enhance the separability between classes
  and give more attention to the minority classes. The performance of the proposed
  approach is evaluated using two evaluation scenarios and compared with different
  baseline and state-of-the-art segmentation architectures for Multi-classes Covid-19
  segmentation. The obtained results show that our approach outperforms the comparison
  methods in both Ground-Glass Opacity (GGO) and Consolidation segmentation. On the
  other hand, our approach shows consistent performance when the training data is
  reduced to half, which proves the efficiency of our approach in few-shot learning.
  In contrast, the performance of the comparison methods drops in this scenario. Moreover,
  our approach is able to deal with imbalanced data classes. These advantages prove
  the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed EMB-TrAttUnet approach in a pandemic
  scenario where time is critical to save patient lives.'
