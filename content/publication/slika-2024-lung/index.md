abstract: To create robust and adaptable methods for lung pneumonia diagnosis and
  the assessment of its severity using chest X-rays (CXR), access to well-curated,
  extensive datasets is crucial. Many current severity quantification approaches require
  resource-intensive training for optimal results. Healthcare practitioners require
  efficient computational tools to swiftly identify COVID-19 cases and predict the
  severity of the condition. In this research, we introduce a novel image augmentation
  scheme as well as a neural network model founded on Vision Transformers (ViT) with
  a small number of trainable parameters for quantifying COVID-19 severity and other
  lung diseases. Our method, named Vision Transformer Regressor Infection Prediction
  (ViTReg-IP), leverages a ViT architecture and a regression head. To assess the model's
  adaptability, we evaluate its performance on diverse chest radiograph datasets from
  various open sources. We conduct a comparative analysis against several competing
  deep learning methods. Our results achieved a minimum Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  of 0.569 and 0.512 and a maximum Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PC) of 0.923 and
  0.855 for the geographic extent score and the lung opacity score, respectively,
  when the CXRs from the RALO dataset were used in training. The experimental results
  reveal that our model delivers exceptional performance in severity quantification
  while maintaining robust generalizability, all with relatively modest computational
  requirements. The source codes used in our work are publicly available at https://github.com/bouthainas/ViTReg-IP.
