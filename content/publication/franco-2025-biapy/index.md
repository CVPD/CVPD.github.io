abstract: BiaPy is an open-source library and application that streamlines the use
  of common deep learning approaches for bioimage analysis. Designed to simplify technical
  complexities, it offers an intuitive interface, zero-code notebooks, and Docker
  integration, catering to both users and developers. While focused on deep learning
  workflows for 2D and 3D image data, it enhances performance with multi-GPU capabilities,
  memory optimization, and scalability for large datasets. Although BiaPy does not
  encompass all aspects of bioimage analysis, such as visualization and manual annotation
  tools, it empowers researchers by providing a ready-to-use environment with customizable
  templates that facilitate sophisticated bioimage analysis workflows.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: BiaPy is an open-source tool that simplifies deep learning workflows for 2D and 3D bioimage analysis. With an intuitive interface, zero-code options, and Docker support, it enables scalable processing on large datasets and multi-GPU systems. BiaPy provides customizable templates for tasks like segmentation and detection, making advanced image analysis more accessible to researchers.

  caption: '**BiaPy environment and scope**. BiaPy is a flexible platform for deep learning-based bioimage analysis, supporting both life science users and developers. It processes 2D/3D microscopy data through customizable workflows for tasks like segmentation, classification, and detection. Users can interact via a user-friendly GUI with a step-by-step wizard or use command-line tools. BiaPy supports multiple file formats (TIFF, H5, Zarr), multi-GPU setups, and model integration via the BioImage Model Zoo and TorchVision. Its workflows follow a three-stage structure: pre-processing, model training/inference, and post-processing, with outputs that include predictions, metrics, and analysis reports.'
