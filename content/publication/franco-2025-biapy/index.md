abstract: BiaPy is an open-source library and application that streamlines the use
  of common deep learning approaches for bioimage analysis. Designed to simplify technical
  complexities, it offers an intuitive interface, zero-code notebooks, and Docker
  integration, catering to both users and developers. While focused on deep learning
  workflows for 2D and 3D image data, it enhances performance with multi-GPU capabilities,
  memory optimization, and scalability for large datasets. Although BiaPy does not
  encompass all aspects of bioimage analysis, such as visualization and manual annotation
  tools, it empowers researchers by providing a ready-to-use environment with customizable
  templates that facilitate sophisticated bioimage analysis workflows.
