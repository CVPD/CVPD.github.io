abstract: Adaptation to new environments is key for organisms’ survival, but also
  for their invasiveness in their introduced areas. Behaviour is considered the fastest
  phenotype allowing adaptation, but its plasticity can involve costs as neural development.
  Although individuals’ investment in cognition was pointed out as unnecessary for
  colony behaviour in eusocial insects, recent studies are highlighting the behavioural
  dependence on neural traits in eusocial insects. The costs of producing behavioural
  and neural plastic offspring could exceed the investments of eusocial insects, in
  which one or certain reproductives must produce multiple offspring. Thus, we wanted
  to analyse the link between the neuroanatomy and the behavioural variability of
  Linepithema humile, an invasive species organised in supercolony units containing
  millions of individuals, to understand its adaptive mechanisms. We repeatedly tested
  same aged callow workers of L. humile in behavioural tests of increasing environmental
  complexity and analysed the volume of their brain functional areas (neuropils) and
  the synaptic clusters abundance in the mushroom body calices (information processing).
  Given the potential large cost of plasticity, we expected to find homogeneous interindividual
  neuronal structures and behavioural responses. Although L. humile is considered
  a monomorphic species, body size conditioned behavioural and neural traits and determined
  individuals efficiency in exploring simple environments. Contrary to our expectations,
  the increase in environmental complexity revealed the behavioural plasticity of
  Linepithema humile workers as well as its correlation with neuropil volumes and
  synaptic clusters. Our results highlight the relevance of the central complex and
  the mushroom bodies on exploration efficiency rather than optic and olfactory lobes.
  Behavioural plasticity under complex environments relied on the synaptic connections
  of the olfactory processing area (dense lip), while individuals with higher number
  of synaptic connections on the visual processing area (collar) explored complex
  environments less efficiently. Our results suggest that behavioural differences
  that correlate with morphological traits might promote adaptive mechanisms in simple
  environments, whereas neurologically based plastic behavior may be necessary to
  adapt in complex environments.
