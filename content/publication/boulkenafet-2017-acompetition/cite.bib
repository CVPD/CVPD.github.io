 abstract = {In recent years, software-based face presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have seen a great progress. However, most existing schemes are not able to generalize well in more realistic conditions. The objective of this competition is to evaluate and compare the generalization performances of mobile face PAD techniques under some real-world variations, including unseen input sensors, presentation attack instruments (PAI) and illumination conditions, on a larger scale OULU-NPU dataset using its standard evaluation protocols and metrics. Thirteen teams from academic and industrial institutions across the world participated in this competition. This time typical liveness detection based on physiological signs of life was totally discarded. Instead, every submitted system relies practically on some sort of feature representation extracted from the face and/or background regions using hand-crafted, learned or hybrid descriptors. Interesting results and findings are presented and discussed in this paper.},
