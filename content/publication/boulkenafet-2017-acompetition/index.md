abstract: In recent years, software-based face presentation attack detection (PAD)
  methods have seen a great progress. However, most existing schemes are not able
  to generalize well in more realistic conditions. The objective of this competition
  is to evaluate and compare the generalization performances of mobile face PAD techniques
  under some real-world variations, including unseen input sensors, presentation attack
  instruments (PAI) and illumination conditions, on a larger scale OULU-NPU dataset
  using its standard evaluation protocols and metrics. Thirteen teams from academic
  and industrial institutions across the world participated in this competition. This
  time typical liveness detection based on physiological signs of life was totally
  discarded. Instead, every submitted system relies practically on some sort of feature
  representation extracted from the face and/or background regions using hand-crafted,
  learned or hybrid descriptors. Interesting results and findings are presented and
  discussed in this paper.
