abstract: "While numerous transgenic mouse strains have been produced to model the
  formation of amyloid-$β$ (A$β$) plaques in the brain, efficient methods for whole-brain
  3D analysis of A$β$ deposits have to be validated and standardized. Moreover, routine
  immunohistochemistry performed on brain slices precludes any shape analysis of A$β$
  plaques, or require complex procedures for serial acquisition and reconstruction.
  The present study shows how in-line (propagation-based) X-ray phase-contrast tomography
  (XPCT) combined with ethanol-induced brain sample dehydration enables hippocampus-wide
  detection and morphometric analysis of A$β$ plaques. Performed in three distinct
  Alzheimer mouse strains, the proposed workflow identified differences in signal
  intensity and 3D shape parameters: 3xTg displayed a different type of A$β$ plaques,
  with a larger volume and area, greater elongation, flatness and mean breadth, and
  more intense average signal than J20 and APP/PS1. As a label-free non-destructive
  technique, XPCT can be combined with standard immunohistochemistry. XPCT virtual
  histology could thus become instrumental in quantifying the 3D spreading and the
  morphological impact of seeding when studying prion-like properties of A$β$ aggregates
  in animal models of Alzheimer's disease. This is Part II of a series of two articles
  reporting the value of in-line XPCT for virtual histology of the brain; Part I shows
  how in-line XPCT enables 3D myelin mapping in the whole rodent brain and in human
  autopsy brain tissue."
