abstract: A large number of well-maintained datasets are needed for the diagnosis
  and assessment of the severity of the new disease (COVID-19) using chest radiographs
  (CXR). To achieve the best results, current methods for quantifying severity require
  complex methods and large datasets for training. Medical professionals must have
  access to systems that can quickly and automatically identify COVID-19 patients
  and predict severity. In this work, we measure the severity of COVID-19 using an
  efficient neural network consisting of a CNN backbone and a regression head to automatically
  predict lung infection scores. In addition, we investigate the efficiency of some
  augmentation methods to increase the potential of the deep model. A comparative
  study was conducted using several state-of-the-art deep learning methods on the
  public RALO dataset. The experimental results show that our model has the potential
  to perform best on severity quantification tasks and demonstrate the impact of lung
  segmentation on performance.
