abstract: This study introduces a groundbreaking structure for semi-supervised learning
  based on graphs. Our technique provides an all-encompassing strategy that simultaneously
  tackles the challenges of label prediction and linear transformation. Specifically,
  the linear transformation we advocate is designed to forge a distinguishing subspace,
  thereby significantly compressing the dataâ€™s dimensionality.In advancing semi-supervised
  learning techniques, our framework particularly focuses on effectively utilizing
  the intrinsic data configuration and the provisional labels related to the unlabeled
  examples in our possession. This distinctive methodology leads to a more sophisticated
  and discriminative form of linear transformation. Tests carried out on authentic
  image datasets clearly validate the efficiency of the method we advocate. These
  tests repeatedly show enhanced performance in contrast to semi-supervised strategies
  that address the fusion of data and label deduction in isolation.
