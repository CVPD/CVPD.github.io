abstract: 'Multi-view clustering attempts to partition unlabeled objects into clusters
  by making full use of complementary and consistent information in the features of
  multiple views. Most existing methods perform this task in three sequential phases:
  Estimating individual or consistent similarity matrices, spectral embedding, and
  cluster partitioning. In this paper, we present a novel method that can overcome
  some of the shortcomings of previous multi-view clustering methods. Our approach
  is called \"Multi-view Clustering via Kernelized Graph and Nonnegative Embedding\".
  Based on a single global criterion, it can jointly provide the consistent similarity
  matrix for all views, the consistent spectral representation, the soft cluster assignments,
  and the view weights. To our knowledge, our approach is the first to combine all
  these unknown matrices into a single criterion. Our proposed scheme has two interesting
  properties that the recent works do not have simultaneously. First, the proposed
  approach does not require an additional clustering step since the clustering assignments
  are solved directly. Second, the soft cluster assignments are directly linked to
  the representation of the views. Several experiments on real datasets demonstrate
  the effectiveness of the proposed method. It performs well compared to many competing
  methods.'
