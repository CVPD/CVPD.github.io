abstract: 'Recently, multi-view clustering has received much attention in the fields
  of machine learning and pattern recognition. Spectral clustering for single and
  multiple views has been the common solution. Despite its good clustering performance,
  it has a major limitation: it requires an extra step of clustering. This extra step,
  which could be the famous k-means clustering, depends heavily on initialization,
  which may affect the quality of the clustering result. To overcome this problem,
  a new method called Multi-view Clustering via Consensus Graph Learning and Nonnegative
  Embedding (MVCGE) is presented in this paper. In the proposed approach, the consensus
  affinity matrix (graph matrix), consensus representation and cluster index matrix
  (nonnegative embedding) are learned simultaneously in a unified framework. Our proposed
  method takes as input the different kernel matrices corresponding to the different
  views. The proposed learning model integrates two interesting constraints: (i) the
  cluster indices should be as smooth as possible over the consensus graph and (ii)
  the cluster indices are set to be as close as possible to the graph convolution
  of the consensus representation. In this approach, no post-processing such as k-means
  or spectral rotation is required. Our approach is tested with real and synthetic
  datasets. The experiments performed show that the proposed method performs well
  compared to many state-of-the-art approaches.'
