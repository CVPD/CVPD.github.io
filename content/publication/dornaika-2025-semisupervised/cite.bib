 abstract = {Semi-supervised learning with a graph-based approach has become increasingly popular in machine learning, particularly when dealing with situations where labeling data is a costly process. Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) have been widely employed in semi-supervised learning, primarily on graph-structured data like citations and social networks. However, there exists a significant gap in applying these methods to non-graph multi-view data, such as collections of images. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel deep semi-supervised multi-view classification model tailored specifically for non-graph data. This model independently reconstructs individual graphs using a powerful semi-supervised approach and subsequently merges them adaptively into a unified consensus graph. The consensus graph feeds into a unified GCN framework incorporating a label smoothing constraint. To assess the efficacy of the proposed model, experiments were conducted across seven multi-view image datasets. Results demonstrate that this model excels in both the graph generation and semi-supervised classification phases, consistently outperforming classical GCNs and other existing semi-supervised multi-view classification approaches.},
