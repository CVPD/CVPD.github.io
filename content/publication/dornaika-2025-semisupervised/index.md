abstract: Semi-supervised learning with a graph-based approach has become increasingly
  popular in machine learning, particularly when dealing with situations where labeling
  data is a costly process. Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) have been widely employed
  in semi-supervised learning, primarily on graph-structured data like citations and
  social networks. However, there exists a significant gap in applying these methods
  to non-graph multi-view data, such as collections of images. To bridge this gap,
  we introduce a novel deep semi-supervised multi-view classification model tailored
  specifically for non-graph data. This model independently reconstructs individual
  graphs using a powerful semi-supervised approach and subsequently merges them adaptively
  into a unified consensus graph. The consensus graph feeds into a unified GCN framework
  incorporating a label smoothing constraint. To assess the efficacy of the proposed
  model, experiments were conducted across seven multi-view image datasets. Results
  demonstrate that this model excels in both the graph generation and semi-supervised
  classification phases, consistently outperforming classical GCNs and other existing
  semi-supervised multi-view classification approaches.
