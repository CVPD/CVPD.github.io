abstract: 'Despite the advances in semi-supervised learning methods, these algorithms
  face three limitations. The first is the assumption of pre-constructed graphs and
  the second is their inability to process large databases. The third limitation is
  that these methods ignore the topological imbalance of the data in a graph. In this
  paper, we address these limitations and propose a new approach called Weighted Simultaneous
  Graph Construction and Reduced Flexible Manifold Embedding (W-SGRFME). To overcome
  the first limitation, we construct the affinity graph using an automatic algorithm
  within the learning process. The second limitation concerns the ability of the model
  to handle a large number of unlabeled samples. To this end, the anchors are included
  in the algorithm as data representatives, and an inductive algorithm is used to
  estimate the labeling of a large number of unseen samples. To address the topological
  imbalance of the data samples, we introduced the Renode method to assign weights
  to the labeled samples. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method through
  experimental results on two large datasets commonly used in semi-supervised learning:
  Covtype and MNIST. The results demonstrate the superiority of the W-SGRFME method
  over two recently proposed models and emphasize its effectiveness in dealing with
  large datasets.'
