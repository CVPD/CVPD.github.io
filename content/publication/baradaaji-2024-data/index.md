abstract: In this paper, a novel framework for semi-supervised learning based on graphs
  is introduced. We present an innovative approach for concurrently estimating label
  inference and performing a linear transformation. This specific linear transformation
  is directed towards achieving a discriminant subspace, which effectively reduces
  the dimensionality of the data. To enhance the semisupervised learning process,
  our framework places a strong emphasis on leveraging the inherent data structure
  and incorporating the information provided by soft labels from the available unlabeled
  samples. The method we propose ultimately results in an improved discriminative
  linear transformation. The effectiveness of our approach is verified through a series
  of experiments conducted on real image datasets. These experiments not only confirm
  the efficacy of our proposed method but also demonstrate its superior performance
  when compared to semi-supervised methods that simultaneously incorporate integration
  and label inference.
