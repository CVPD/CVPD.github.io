abstract: 'Background/Objectives: Rapid and accurate assessment of lung diseases,
  like pneumonia, is critical for effective clinical decision-making, particularly
  during pandemics when disease progression can be severe. Early diagnosis plays a
  crucial role in preventing complications, necessitating the development of fast
  and efficient AI-based models for automated severity assessment. Methods: In this
  study, we introduce a novel approach that leverages VMamba, a state-of-the-art vision
  model based on the VisualStateSpace (VSS) framework and 2D-Selective-Scan (SS2D)
  spatial scanning, to enhance lung severity prediction. Integrated in a parallel
  multi-image regions approach, VMamba effectively captures global and local contextual
  features through structured state-space modeling, improving feature representation
  and robustness in medical image analysis. Additionally, we integrate a segmented
  lung replacement augmentation strategy to enhance data diversity and improve model
  generalization. The proposed method is trained on the RALO and COVID-19 datasets
  and compared against state-of-the-art models. Results: Experimental results demonstrate
  that our approach achieves superior performance, outperforming existing techniques
  in prediction accuracy and robustness. Key evaluation metrics, including Mean Absolute
  Error (MAE) and Pearson Correlation (PC), confirm the modelâ€™s effectiveness, while
  the incorporation of segmented lung replacement augmentation further enhances adaptability
  to diverse lung conditions. Conclusions: These findings highlight the potential
  of our method for reliable and immediate clinical applications in lung infection
  assessment.'
