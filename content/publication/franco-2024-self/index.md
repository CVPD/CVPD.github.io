abstract: Fluorescence microscopy plays a crucial role in cellular analysis but is
  often hindered by phototoxicity and limited spectral channels. Label-free transmitted
  light microscopy presents an attractive alternative, yet recovering fluorescence
  images from such inputs remains difficult. In this work, we address the Cell Painting
  problem within the LightMyCells challenge at the International Symposium on Biomedical
  Imaging (ISBI) 2024, aiming to predict optimally focused fluorescence images from
  label-free transmitted light inputs. Leveraging advancements self-supervised Vision
  Transformers, our method overcomes the constraints of scarce annotated biomedical
  data and fluorescence microscopy’s drawbacks. Four specialized models, each targeting
  a different organelle, are pretrained in a self-supervised manner to enhance model
  generalization. Our method, integrated within the open-source BiaPy library, contributes
  to the advancement of image-to-image deep-learning techniques in cellular analysis,
  offering a promising solution for robust and accurate fluorescence image prediction
  from label-free transmitted light inputs. Code and documentation can be found at
