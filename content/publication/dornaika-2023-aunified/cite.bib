 abstract = {In recent years, semi-supervised learning on graphs has gained importance in many fields and applications. The goal is to use both partially labeled data (labeled examples) and a large amount of unlabeled data to build more effective predictive models. Deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are very useful in both unsupervised and semi-supervised learning problems. As a special class of GNNs, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) aim to obtain data representation through graph-based node smoothing and layer-wise neural network transformations. However, GCNs have some weaknesses when applied to semi-supervised graph learning: (1) it ignores the manifold structure implicitly encoded by the graph; (2) it uses a fixed neighborhood graph and focuses only on the convolution of a graph, but pays little attention to graph construction; (3) it rarely considers the problem of topological imbalance. To overcome the above shortcomings, in this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning method called Re-weight Nodes and Graph Learning Convolutional Network with Manifold Regularization (ReNode-GLCNMR). Our proposed method simultaneously integrates graph learning and graph convolution into a unified network architecture, which also enforces label smoothing through an unsupervised loss term. At the same time, it addresses the problem of imbalance in graph topology by adaptively reweighting the influence of labeled nodes based on their distances to the class boundaries. Experiments on 8 benchmark datasets show that ReNode-GLCNMR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-supervised GNN methods.},
