abstract: 'In recent years, semi-supervised learning on graphs has gained importance
  in many fields and applications. The goal is to use both partially labeled data
  (labeled examples) and a large amount of unlabeled data to build more effective
  predictive models. Deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are very useful in both unsupervised
  and semi-supervised learning problems. As a special class of GNNs, Graph Convolutional
  Networks (GCNs) aim to obtain data representation through graph-based node smoothing
  and layer-wise neural network transformations. However, GCNs have some weaknesses
  when applied to semi-supervised graph learning: (1) it ignores the manifold structure
  implicitly encoded by the graph; (2) it uses a fixed neighborhood graph and focuses
  only on the convolution of a graph, but pays little attention to graph construction;
  (3) it rarely considers the problem of topological imbalance. To overcome the above
  shortcomings, in this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning method
  called Re-weight Nodes and Graph Learning Convolutional Network with Manifold Regularization
  (ReNode-GLCNMR). Our proposed method simultaneously integrates graph learning and
  graph convolution into a unified network architecture, which also enforces label
  smoothing through an unsupervised loss term. At the same time, it addresses the
  problem of imbalance in graph topology by adaptively reweighting the influence of
  labeled nodes based on their distances to the class boundaries. Experiments on 8
  benchmark datasets show that ReNode-GLCNMR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
  semi-supervised GNN methods.'
