abstract: This study explores the application of advanced deep learning techniques
  in analyzing Upper Palaeolithic hand stencil representations, focusing on sex classification
  of individuals involved in prehistoric rock art activity. The research highlights
  the effectiveness of deep learning models, particularly EfficientNetV2-S, which
  achieved an accuracy rate of 81.03% for experimental blown hand stencils and 95.08%
  in delineated contemporary hand image samples for sex identification, surpassing
  traditional morphometric methods. The study demonstrates that deep learning can
  differentiate male and female hand stencils with high precision, suggesting a mixed-sexual
  participation in creating prehistoric art, with a slight prevalence of male hand
  representations in the studied caves. The integration of user-friendly platforms,
  such as Google Colab, facilitates the reproducibility and validation of these findings,
  promoting methodological transparency. However, the accuracy of deep learning models
  is contingent on the quality and preservation of the images, presenting challenges
  when working with deteriorated or incomplete samples. This work highlights the potential
  of advanced technologies in archaeological research, opening new avenues for investigating
  the creation of prehistoric graphic expressions and their social implications.
