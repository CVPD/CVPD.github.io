abstract: Lung diseases, including COVID-19, can be considered a serious health problem.
  In order for patients to be identified to make better decisions and receive the
  appropriate treatment that can save their lives, rapid and accurate diagnosis of
  pulmonary infections is critical. In this study, we propose a multi-task deep learning
  algorithm to quickly and effectively determine the severity of pulmonary infection
  in patients with COVID-19 or similar pulmonary diseases. The main contributions
  are as follows. First, we propose a multi-task network based on a dual transformer
  encoder followed by a feature fusion module feeding two MLP regression heads. Second,
  we introduce an online combination of region and score for image augmentation. The
  resulting network quantifies CXR images with two scores that characterize two types
  of infection. One score is based on the spread of infection in the lung, while the
  other measures how opaque the infected sites are. The proposed approach is evaluated
  using chest radiographs (CXR) from the public RALO dataset. Compared to prediction
  models in the literature, our multi-task technique outperforms them. At the time
  of inference, the proposed model has the highest Pearson correlation coefficient
  and the lowest mean absolute error. Our results show that accurate diagnosis of
  lung severity can be achieved by generating two assessment scores in a multi-tasking
  model.
