 abstract = {In this article, we present a novel method for the automatic 3D reconstruction
of thick tissue blocks from 2D histological sections. The algorithm
completes a high-content (multi-scale, multifeature) imaging system
for simultaneous morphological and molecular analysis of thick tissue
samples. This computer-based system integrates image acquisition,
annotation, registration, and three-dimensional reconstruction. We
present an experimental validation of this tool using both synthetic
and real data. In particular, we present the 3D reconstruction of
an entire mouse mammary gland and demonstrate the integration of
high-resolution molecular data. Microsc. Res. Tech. 73: 1019-1029,
