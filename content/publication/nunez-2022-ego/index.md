abstract: 'The egocentric action recognition EAR field has recently increased its
  popularity due to the affordable and lightweight wearable cameras available nowadays
  such as GoPro and similars. Therefore, the amount of egocentric data generated has
  increased, triggering the interest in the understanding of egocentric videos. More
  specifically, the recognition of actions in egocentric videos has gained popularity
  due to the challenge that it poses: the wild movement of the camera and the lack
  of context make it hard to recognise actions with a performance similar to that
  of third-person vision solutions. This has ignited the research interest on the
  field and, nowadays, many public datasets and competitions can be found in both
  the machine learning and the computer vision communities. In this survey, we aim
  to analyse the literature on egocentric vision methods and algorithms. For that,
  we propose a taxonomy to divide the literature into various categories with subcategories,
  contributing a more fine-grained classification of the available methods. We also
  provide a review of the zero-shot approaches used by the EAR community, a methodology
  that could help to transfer EAR algorithms to real-world applications. Finally,
  we summarise the datasets used by researchers in the literature.'
