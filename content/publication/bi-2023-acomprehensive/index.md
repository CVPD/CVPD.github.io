abstract: Deep Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have gained increasing prominence across
  various fields and applications in recent years. In particular, Graph Convolutional
  Network (GCN), a specialized GNN, has emerged as a powerful tool for obtaining data
  representations through the processes of graph-based node smoothing and implementing
  transformations through neural networks layer by layer. Although GCN excels in the
  area of semi-supervised learning, it also has its weaknesses. In particular, it
  1) tends to overlook the implicit manifold structure of graph data, 2) focuses primarily
  on graph convolutions, often neglects the graph construction, and 3) rarely addresses
  topological imbalances. In response to these limitations, we present a comprehensive
  deep semi-supervised Graph Learning approach incorporating Node Re-weighting and
  Manifold Regularization (ReNode-GLCNMR). This innovative approach corrects topological
  inconsistencies in the graph and adaptively reweights labeled nodes. It also seamlessly
  combines graph learning and graph convolution within one GCN architecture. Moreover,
  it imposes label smoothing by utilizing an unsupervised loss item. Our experiments
  on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that our ReNode-GLCNMR model surpasses the
  performance of the most advanced semi-supervised GNN methods available.
