abstract: Deep learning (DL) has made significant advances in computer vision with
  the advent of vision transformers (ViTs). Unlike convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
  ViTs use self-attention to extract both local and global features from image data,
  and then apply residual connections to feed these features directly into a fully
  networked multilayer perceptron head. In hospitals, hematologists prepare peripheral
  blood smears (PBSs) and read them under a medical microscope to detect abnormalities
  in blood counts such as leukemia. However, this task is time-consuming and prone
  to human error. This study investigated the transfer learning process of the Google
  ViT and ImageNet CNNs to automate the reading of PBSs. The study used two online
  PBS datasets, PBC and BCCD, and transferred them into balanced datasets to investigate
  the influence of data amount and noise immunity on both neural networks. The PBC
  results showed that the Google ViT is an excellent DL neural solution for data scarcity.
  The BCCD results showed that the Google ViT is superior to ImageNet CNNs in dealing
  with unclean, noisy image data because it is able to extract both global and local
  features and use residual connections, despite the additional time and computational
  overhead.
