abstract: 'In recent times, the topic of human facial age estimation attracted much
  attention. This is due to its ability to improve biometrics systems. Recently, several
  applications that are based on the demographic attributes estimation have been developed.
  These include law enforcement, re-identification in videos, planed marketing, intelligent
  advertising, social media, and human-computer interaction. The main contributions
  of the paper are as follows. Firstly, it extends some handcrafted models that are
  based on the Pyramid Multi Level (PML) face representation. Secondly, it evaluates
  the performance of two different kinds of features that are handcrafted and deep
  features. It compares handcrafted and deep features in terms of accuracy and computational
  complexity. The proposed scheme of study includes the following three main steps:
  1) face preprocessing; 2) feature extraction (two different kinds of features are
  studied: handcrafted and deep features); 3) feeding the obtained features to a linear
  regressor. In addition, we investigate the strengths and weaknesses of handcrafted
  and deep features when used in facial age estimation. Experiments are run on three
  public databases (FG-NET, PAL and FACES). These experiments show that both handcrafted
  and deep features are effective for facial age estimation.'
