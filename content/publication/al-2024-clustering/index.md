abstract: Graph convolution networks (GCNs) have emerged as powerful approaches for
  semi-supervised classification of attributed graph data. In this paper, we introduce
  a novel objective function designed for training GCNs in an unsupervised learning
  setting, specifically for clustering purposes. Our proposed loss function is comprised
  solely of unsupervised components. The first component encompasses the kernel k-means
  objective function, which captures shared feature information among nodes, while
  the second component serves as a regularization term, promoting the smoothness of
  predicted clusters across the entire dataset. By employing this objective function,
  we preserve the strengths of conventional semi-supervised GCNs while adapting them
  to the demands of unsupervised clustering tasks. Experimental results, based on
  standard benchmark datasets, demonstrate that our unsupervised GCN outperforms contemporary
  state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.
