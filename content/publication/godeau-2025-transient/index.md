abstract: In embryos, epithelial sealing proceeds with progressive zipping eventually
  leading to a scar-free epithelium and ensuring the assembly of body segments in
  insects and neural tube in mammals. How zipping is mechanically controlled to promote
  tissue fusion on long distances, remains unclear. Combining physical modeling with
  genetic and mechanical perturbations, we reveal the existence of a transient contractile
  seam that generates forces to reduce the zipping angle by force balance, consequently
  promoting epidermal sealing during Drosophila embryogenesis. The seam is formed
  by the adhesion of two tissues, the epidermis and amnioserosa, and is stabilized
  by the tensions generated by the segment boundaries. Once a segment is zipped, the
  seam disassembles concurrently with the inactivation of the Jun kinase pathway.
  Thus, we show that epithelial sealing is promoted by a transient actomyosin contractile
  seam allowing sequential segment assembly.
