abstract: 'Recently, automatic personality analysis is becoming an interesting topic
  for computer vision. Many attempts have been proposed to solve this problem using
  time-based sequence information. In this paper, we present a new framework for estimating
  the Big-Five personality traits and job candidate screening variable from video
  sequences. The framework consists of two parts: (1) the use of Pyramid Multi-level
  (PML) to extract raw facial textures at different scales and levels; (2) the extension
  of the Covariance Descriptor (COV) to fuse different local texture features of the
  face image such as Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Local Directional Pattern (LDP),
  Binarized Statistical Image Features (BSIF), and Local Phase Quantization (LPQ).
  Therefore, the COV descriptor uses the textures of PML face parts to generate rich
  low-level face features that are encoded using concatenation of all PML blocks in
  a feature vector. Finally, the entire video sequence is represented by aggregating
  these frame vectors and extracting the most relevant features. The exploratory results
  on the ChaLearn LAP APA2016 dataset compare well with state-of-the-art methods including
  deep learning-based methods.'
