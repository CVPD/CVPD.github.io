abstract: Nowadays, one-step multi-view clustering algorithms attract many interests.
  The main issue of multi-view clustering approaches is how to combine the information
  extracted from the available views. A popular approach is to use view-based graphs
  and/or a consensus graph to describe the different views. We introduce a novel one-step
  graph-based multi-view clustering approach in this study. Our suggested method,
  in contrast to existing graph-based one-step clustering methods, provides two major
  novelties to the method called Nonnegative Embedding and Spectral Embedding (NESE)
  proposed in the recent paper [1]. To begin, we use the cluster label correlation
  to create an additional graph in addition to the graphs associated with the data
  space. Second, the cluster-label matrix is constrained by adopting some restrictions
  to make it more consistent. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated
  by experimental results on many public datasets.
