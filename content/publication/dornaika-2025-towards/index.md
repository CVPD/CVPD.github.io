abstract: In the realm of graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL), traditional
  methodologies often struggle to effectively handle labeled samples and scale to
  accommodate large datasets. To increase supervision information in semi-supervised
  learning, the self-training paradigm is often used, mainly in datasets with moderate
  sizes. On the other hand, the use of anchors was adopted with large datasets. In
  this research endeavor, we propose a novel framework for GSSL that leverages a novel
  self-training principle tailored for very large datasets, and introduces an advanced
  method for automatic graph construction using anchors. Our approach focuses on utilizing
  generated labels of random batches of unlabeled samples, subsequently incorporating
  these predictions into the training set to enhance the model's accuracy. Pseudo-labeling,
  a specific instance of self-training, assigns pseudo-labels to the most confidently
  predicted unlabeled examples, treating them as ground truth during the training
  phase. By constructing anchor-to-anchor affinity graphs that incorporate both feature
  and label information, our method facilitates robust learning on large-scale datasets.
  Through comprehensive experimentation across diverse large datasets, our approach
  demonstrates its efficacy in achieving scalable and reliable semi-supervised learning
  outcomes. These findings represent a significant advancement in the field of GSSL,
  with wide-ranging implications for various applications across different domains.
  Our method not only addresses the scalability issue but also ensures the effective
  integration of both labeled and pseudo labeled data, thereby enhancing the overall
  learning process.
