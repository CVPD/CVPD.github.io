abstract: Wound healing is a fundamental mechanism for living animals. Understanding
  the process is crucial for numerous medical applications ranging from scarless healing
  to faster tissue regeneration and safer post-surgery recovery. In this work, we
  collect a dataset of time-lapse sequences of Drosophila embryos recovering from
  a laser-incised wound. We model the wound healing process as a video prediction
  task for which we utilize a two-stage approach with a vector quantized variational
  autoencoder and an autoregressive transformer. We show our trained model is able
  to generate realistic videos conditioned on the initial frames of the healing. We
  evaluate the model predictions using distortion measures and perceptual quality
  metrics based on segmented wound masks. Our results show that the predictions keep
  pixel-level error low while behaving in a realistic manner, thus suggesting the
  neural network is able to model the wound-closing process.
