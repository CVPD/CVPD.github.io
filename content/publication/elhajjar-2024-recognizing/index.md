abstract: 'Machine learning, particularly classification algorithms, has been widely
  employed for diagnosing COVID-19 cases. However, these methods typically rely on
  labeled datasets and analyze a single data view. With the vast amount of patient
  data available without labels, this paper addresses the novel challenge of unsupervised
  COVID-19 diagnosis. The goal is to harness the abundant data without labels effectively.
  In recent times, multi-view clustering has garnered considerable attention in the
  research community. Spectral clustering, known for its robust theoretical framework,
  is a key focus. However, traditional spectral clustering methods generate only nonlinear
  data projections, necessitating additional clustering steps. The quality of these
  post-processing steps can be influenced by various factors, such as initialization
  procedures and outliers. This paper introduces an enhanced version of the recent
  “Multiview Spectral Clustering via integrating Nonnegative Embedding and Spectral
  Embedding” method. While retaining the benefits of the original technique, the proposed
  model integrates two essential constraints: (1) a constraint for ensuring the consistent
  smoothness of the nonnegative embedding across all views and (2) an orthogonality
  constraint imposed on the columns of the nonnegative embedding matrix. The effectiveness
  of this approach is demonstrated using COVIDx datasets. Additionally, the method
  is evaluated on other image datasets to validate its suitability for this study.'
