abstract: 'In this paper, we present the results of the MitoEM challenge on mitochondria
  3D instance segmentation from electron microscopy images, organized in conjunction
  with the IEEE-ISBI 2021 conference. Our benchmark dataset consists of two large-scale
  3D volumes, one from human and one from rat cortex tissue, which are 1,986 times
  larger than previously used datasets. At the time of paper submission, 257 participants
  had registered for the challenge, 14 teams had submitted their results, and six
  teams participated in the challenge workshop. Here, we present eight top-performing
  approaches from the challenge participants, along with our own baseline strategies.
  Posterior to the challenge, annotation errors in the ground truth were corrected
  without altering the final ranking. Additionally, we present a retrospective evaluation
  of the scoring system which revealed that: 1) challenge metric was permissive with
  the false positive predictions; and 2) size-based grouping of instances did not
  correctly categorize mitochondria of interest. Thus, we propose a new scoring system
  that better reflects the correctness of the segmentation results. Although several
  of the top methods are compared favorably to our own baselines, substantial errors
  remain unsolved for mitochondria with challenging morphologies. Thus, the challenge
  remains open for submission and automatic evaluation, with all volumes available
  for download.'
