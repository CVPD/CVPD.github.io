abstract: The National Safety Council (NSC) has reported that each year, driver fatigue
  is responsible for 100,000 accidents, 71,000 injuries, and 1,550 fatalities, often
  manifesting as drowsiness. Most current systems fail to anticipate accidents beforehand,
  focusing primarily on external factors. This paper introduces a novel drowsiness
  detection framework aimed at reducing accidents caused by drivers dozing off behind
  the wheel and minimizing harm to individuals engaged in prolonged computer use.
  The proposed method leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a semi-supervised
  learning technique, setting it apart from existing approaches. The effectiveness
  of our approach is evaluated using the UTA-RLDD video dataset, and the results demonstrate
  that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 99.98%
  accuracy.
