abstract: The creation of image classification and segmentation Machine Learning products
  requires the annotation of different classes by experts as well as the management
  of large volumes of data. This paper introduces a new methodology to optimize the
  computational execution and expert-user contribution by introducing a pixel quality
  indicator and, therefore reducing the number of annotated data used for model training,
  based on the geometric information of each pixel. The developed pixel-level quality
  indicator shows beneficial results, as a result of improving semantic segmentation
  and classification tasks' performance, validated through the IRIS 1 platform.
