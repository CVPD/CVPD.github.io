### üéØ About the PhD Project  

The doctoral research will focus on the **development of new deep learning methodologies for biomedical image analysis**, aiming to overcome key limitations such as **scarcity of annotated data, computational scalability, and model generalization**.  

The selected PhD student will investigate **partially supervised learning strategies** (self-/semi-supervised, few/zero-shot learning) and the **adaptation of foundation models** to bioimage analysis tasks, including **segmentation, classification, and object detection** of cellular and tissue structures. The work will combine **state-of-the-art AI methods** with validation on real biomedical data, contributing to the creation of **robust and accessible tools for the scientific community** through platforms such as [**BiaPy**](https://biapyx.github.io/).

### üë©‚Äçüéì Candidate Profile  

- Degree and Master in **Computer Science, Mathematics, Telecommunication Engineering, Physics, Bioinformatics, or related fields**.  
- Skills in **scientific programming** (Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, computer vision libraries).  
- Good command of **English** (spoken and written).  
- Strong motivation for **interdisciplinary research** at the interface of computer vision, deep learning, and biomedical imaging.  

Additional valued merits include prior experience in AI/bioimage projects, contributions to open-source software, and participation in international collaborations.
