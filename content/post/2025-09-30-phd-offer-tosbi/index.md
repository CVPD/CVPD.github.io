### 🎯 About the PhD Project  

The doctoral research will focus on the **development of new deep learning methodologies for biomedical image analysis**, addressing critical challenges such as **scarcity of annotated data, computational scalability, and model generalization**.  

The selected PhD student will explore **partially supervised learning strategies** (self-/semi-supervised, few/zero-shot learning) and the **adaptation of foundation models** to bioimage analysis tasks, including **segmentation, classification, and object detection** of cellular and tissue structures. The project combines **state-of-the-art AI techniques** with **validation on real biomedical datasets**, contributing to the creation of **robust and accessible tools** for the research community through platforms such as [**BiaPy**](https://biapyx.github.io/).  

---

### 👩‍🎓 Candidate Profile  

- Degree and Master’s in **Computer Science, Mathematics, Telecommunication Engineering, Physics, Bioinformatics, or related fields**.  
- Skills in **scientific programming** (Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, computer vision libraries).  
- Good command of **English** (spoken and written).  
- Motivation for **interdisciplinary research** at the interface of computer vision, deep learning, and biomedical imaging.  

Additional valued merits include prior experience in AI or bioimage projects, contributions to open-source software, and participation in international collaborations.
