### 🧠 Thesis Contributions

Bouthaina’s PhD work focuses on developing **deep learning models and novel data augmentation methods** for **accurate and efficient assessment of pulmonary diseases** using chest X-rays (CXR) and CT scans. Her research addresses critical challenges in **COVID-19, pneumonia, and related pulmonary infections**, making strides toward practical, clinically relevant AI systems.  

Key contributions include:  

- **Multi-Score Prediction of Lung Infection Severity**  
  A novel **multi-task deep learning algorithm** combining a dual transformer encoder and feature fusion module. This method simultaneously predicts infection spread and opacity scores, improving accuracy and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines (*IEEE TETCI*, 2025).  

- **Parallel VMamba + Attention Model**  
  A cutting-edge approach using the **VisualStateSpace (VSS)** framework and **segmented lung replacement augmentation**, enabling robust pneumonia severity prediction from CXRs with excellent generalization (*Diagnostics*, 2025).  

- **PViTGAtt-IP Architecture**  
  A parallel vision transformer model with cross-attention for **severity quantification in both CXRs and CT scans**, validated across multiple datasets (*IEEE Transactions on Big Data*, 2025).

- **Lightweight Vision Transformer for CXR Severity**  
  Developed **ViTReg-IP**, a transformer-based regressor requiring fewer parameters but maintaining high accuracy and robustness across diverse datasets (*MBEC*, 2024).

- **Multi-task Vision Transformer (MViTReg-IP)**  
  Introduced a method for predicting infection extent and opacity simultaneously, improving diagnostic reliability (*Conference paper, 2024*).

- **SuperpixelGridMasks Augmentation**  
  Co-developed a new **data augmentation technique** based on superpixel decomposition, now publicly available on GitHub, showing strong improvements across biomedical and real-world datasets (*Journal of Healthcare Informatics Research*, 2022).
