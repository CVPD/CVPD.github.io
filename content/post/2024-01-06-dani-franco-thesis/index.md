Daniel's thesis, titled **"Deep Learning for Bioimage Analysis: novel user- and developer-oriented approaches"**, explores the transformative role of deep learning in the field of biological imaging‚Äîfrom robust and scalable segmentation pipelines to open-source tools that make advanced AI accessible to researchers worldwide.

The defense committee was composed of:
- üß† **Gorka Azkune** - HiTZ Center - Ixa, University of the Basque Country  
- üî¨ **Anatole Chessel** - Laboratory for Optics and Biosciences, √âcole Polytechnique, France  
- üß¨ **Virginie Uhlmann** - Director of the BioVisionCenter, University of Zurich (participated remotely)

Daniel was supervised by **Ignacio Arganda-Carreras** (UPV/EHU, DIPC, Biofisika Institute) and **Arrate Mu√±oz-Barrutia** (UC3M, IISGM), and his work bridges AI, microscopy, and life sciences. His contributions include:

- Developing reproducible and robust deep learning models for biological image segmentation  
- Designing novel domain adaptation strategies for multi-modal datasets  
- Creating and curating the **MitoEM** dataset and challenge for benchmarking mitochondria segmentation  
- Leading the development of **BiaPy**, an open-source deep learning platform for scalable and user-friendly bioimage analysis  
- Applying these methods to real-world biological studies, including epithelial cyst segmentation and label-free cell imaging

üëè Congratulations, Daniel, on this fantastic achievement and for pushing the frontiers of deep learning in bioimaging! We look forward to seeing what comes next in your research journey.
