🎉 Congratulations to **Zoulfikar Ibrahim**, who successfully defended his PhD thesis titled _"Towards Scalable Semi-supervised Learning on Graphs"_ on **April 29th, 2025**! 🎉

<!--more-->

The defense took place at the **University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU)** and was co-supervised by **Dr. Fadi Dornaika** (CVPD group, UPV/EHU) and **Dr. Alireza Bosaghzadeh** (Shahid Rajaee Teacher Training University, Iran).

Zoulfikar's research explored innovative approaches to graph-based learning, focusing on scalability and the challenges of semi-supervised learning when only a limited portion of the data is labeled. His thesis proposed novel techniques and frameworks that significantly advance the state of the art in graph neural networks and label propagation methods, with promising applications in both computer vision and network analysis.

The PhD evaluation committee was composed of:

- **Dr. Jinan Charafeddine** (President, Pôle Universitaire Léonard de Vinci, France)  
- **Dr. Blanca Rosa Cases Gutierrez** (Member, UPV/EHU, Spain)  
- **Dr. Abdelmalik Moujahid** (Member, Universidad Internacional de La Rioja, Spain)  
- **Dr. Karim Hammoudi** (Member, Université de Haute-Alsace, France)  
- **Dr. Denis Hamad** (Secretary, Université du Littoral Côte d'Opale, France)  

👏 We are very proud of Zoulfikar and wish him the best in his future research endeavors!
