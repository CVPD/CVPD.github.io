We’re proud to share that two members of our group have been included in Stanford University’s prestigious ["Ranking of the World Scientists: World’s Top 2% Scientists,"](https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw/5) released on November 3, 2022.

Both the **career-long impact** list and the **single-year impact** list feature **Ignacio Arganda-Carreras** and **Fadi Dornaika** among the world’s most influential researchers.

This ranking is based on standardized citation metrics and highlights those with the highest impact in scientific publications across all disciplines.

👏 A big congratulations to Nacho and Fadi for this well-deserved recognition!
