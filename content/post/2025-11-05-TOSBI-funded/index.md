We are delighted to share that the **TOSBI project — _Towards Scalable and Generalized Solutions in Biomedical Images_ — has been officially funded** by the **Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (MCIU)** under the [*Generación de Conocimiento 2024* program](https://www.aei.gob.es/convocatorias/buscador-convocatorias/proyectos-generacion-conocimiento-2024).

Led by the **CVPD** group at the **University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU)**, TOSBI will develop next-generation deep learning methods that scale efficiently and generalize across diverse biomedical imaging domains.

The project, which runs from **2025 to 2028**, is supported with **143,250€** in funding (including indirect costs).  

📄 Learn more on the [TOSBI project page](/project/tosbi-2025/).

The project also includes a fully funded PhD position.  
🎓 Interested candidates can read the [PhD announcement here](/post/2025-09-30-phd-offer-tosbi/).

We look forward to advancing scalable, annotation-efficient, and robust AI methods for the biomedical imaging community!
