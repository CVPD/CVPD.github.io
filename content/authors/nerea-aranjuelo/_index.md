**Nerea Aranjuelo** is a Senior Researcher in the Connected and Cooperative Automated Systems department of Vicomtech, where she participates in applied research projects related to machine learning and computer vision in the field of transport. She received a BSc in Industrial Technologies (2013) and a MSc in Industrial Engineering (2014), both from the School of Engineering (TECNUN) of the University of Navarra. She received her PhD in Computer Engineering (2023) from the University of the Basque Country in the area of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, under the supervision of [Dr. Ignacio Arganda-Carreras](https://cvpd.github.io/author/ignacio-arganda-carreras/) and Dr. Luis Unzueta.

During her PhD, Nerea’s research focused on different methodologies to obtain suitable data for training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in problems with limited access to large-scale data sources. Potential solutions included using synthetic data generated using 3D graphics-based methods and generative models. She also researched data-oriented DNN design for different modalities, such as images and point clouds. Nerea’s research has contributed to projects related to perception systems in video analytics and automated vehicles. In 2025, Nerea received recognition for her research potential from the Basque Research & Technology Alliance (BRTA).
