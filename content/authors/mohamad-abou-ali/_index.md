**Mohamad Abou Ali** is a faculty member at the Lebanese International University and a postdoctoral researcher in Artificial Intelligence and Medical Image Analysis. He earned his PhD in Informatics Engineering (Cum Laude, with International Doctorate Distinction) from the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), under the supervision of [Professor Fadi Dornaika] (https://cvpd.github.io/author/fadi-dornaika/) and [Professor Ignacio Arganda-Carreras] (https://cvpd.github.io/author/ignacio-arganda-carreras/). He is currently applying for ranking promotion at LIU in recognition of his academic and research achievements.

Dr. Abou Aliâ€™s research pioneers innovations at the intersection of artificial intelligence and biomedical engineering. His work focuses on advancing diagnostic accuracy and annotation efficiency in medical imaging, with contributions to blood cell classification, skin cancer detection, and brain tumor diagnosis from MRI. He is the creator of Naturalize, a novel data augmentation technique that performs precise object-level manipulation using SAM-based segmentation, significantly improving model robustness and addressing class imbalance in clinical datasets.

In addition to his research, Dr. Abou Ali teaches undergraduate and graduate courses at LIU, including Machine Learning, Image Processing, Data Mining, Introduction to Software Engineering, Modeling and Computer Simulation in Medicine, and Medical Imaging. His interdisciplinary work also extends to hospital planning and medical device management, driving the development of intelligent, resource-aware systems for next-generation healthcare. He has published widely in peer-reviewed journals and conferences, and actively contributes to the international research community as a speaker, reviewer, and TPC member.
