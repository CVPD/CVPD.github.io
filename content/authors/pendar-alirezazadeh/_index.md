**Dr. Pendar Alirezazadeh** is a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), working in the Computer Vision and Pattern Discovery (CVPD) group. He earned his PhD in Computer Engineering (Excellent Cum Laude, 2024) under the supervision of Prof. Fadi Dornaika and Prof. Abdelmalik Moujahid.

His research focuses on **Edge AI**, where he develops **lightweight deep learning models** that can operate efficiently on resource-constrained embedded systems. He specializes in **neural network quantization**, **discriminative learning**, and **attention mechanisms**, with the goal of bringing powerful AI capabilities to real-time edge applications.

Dr. Alirezazadeh has authored or co-authored over **35 scientific publications** in prestigious journals such as *Artificial Intelligence Review*, *Computers in Biology and Medicine*, and *ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology*. He is an active reviewer for top-tier journals published by **Elsevier**, **Springer**, and **IEEE Transactions**, and regularly contributes to international conferences.

He also supervises both **Master's and PhD students** in research areas related to efficient AI, computer vision, and embedded learning.
