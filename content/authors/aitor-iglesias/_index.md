**Aitor Iglesias** is a Researcher in the Connected and Cooperative Automated Systems department of Vicomtech where he participates in applied research projects related to machine learning and computer vision in the field of transport. He received a BSc in Computer Science (2022) and a MSc in Computational Engineering and Intelligent Systems (2023), both from the University of the Basque Country. He is currently pursuing a PhD under the supervision of [Dr. Ignacio Arganda-Carreras](https://cvpd.github.io/author/ignacio-arganda-carreras/) and [Dr. Nerea Aranjuelo](https://www.vicomtech.org/es/vicomtech/equipo/768).

His research focuses on improving the reliability and robustness of Autonomous Driving (AD) functions through the use of LiDAR technology. As part of his PhD, Aitor is actively investigating the challenges posed by the domain gap between different LiDAR sensors. His work involves developing advanced LiDAR-based autonomous driving functions with the ultimate goal of improving the safety, reliability, and adaptability of intelligent vehicles in diverse real-world conditions.
