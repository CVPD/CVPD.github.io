He earned his first PhD in Signals and Communications in 2017 and a Master's in Telecommunications in 2013, both from the University of Biskra, Algeria.

Concurrently with his studies, he works as a Senior Engineer at Huawei's R&D Center in Helsinki, focusing on computer vision research and development. His research background is in computer vision, pattern recognition, machine learning, biometrics, document understanding, and image/video generation. His work has centered on developing applied solutions, with key contributions in driver drowsiness detection using deep features , face presentation attack detection, and analyzing facial videos to screen job candidates and assess personality traits.

Prior to his role at Huawei, he was a Postdoctoral researcher at the University of Technology of Belfort-Montb√©liard (UTBM) in France and at the Center for Machine Vision and Signal Analysis (CMVS) in Oulu, Finland. His collaborative work is extensive, resulting in numerous publications on topics such as kinship verification from facial images , gait analysis , and medical imaging.
