**Francisco Javier Iriarte** received his Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the Public University of Navarre (UPNA) in 2019, specializing in Computing and Artificial Intelligence. In 2020, he completed a Master's degree in Machine Learning for Health at the Carlos III University of Madrid (UC3M). He has been working at VICOMTECH since 2021 as a researcher, contributing to the development of computer vision, explainable AI and edge computing projects for intelligent transportation systems and video surveillance.

Since 2022 he is working towards a PhD in Computer Science, co-directed by [Dr. Ignacio Arganda-Carreras](https://cvpd.github.io/author/ignacio-arganda-carreras/) and Dr. Luis Unzueta. His thesis aims to explore optimal methodologies to deploy efficient and explainable AI applications. He has focused his work on researching Explainable AI (XAI) and its potential uses for real-time model monitoring in MLOps environments, contributing to the maintenance of deep learning models deployed in production levels, such as image-based fruit classifiers and reinforcement learning models for port security enhancement.
