**Sally El Hajjar** is a former PhD student of the CVPD group at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), where she earned her doctorate in Computer Science & Engineering (Cum Laude, 2022) under the supervision of Dr. Fadi Dornaika. Her thesis focused on developing graph-based multiview clustering algorithms and their applications.

She is currently a **Senior Research Fellow in Machine Learning** at **The New School University (New York)**, contributing to the **ClimateIQ** project — an AI-driven urban climate risk prediction tool funded by Google.org. Her work includes training autoregressive ConvLSTM models for flood and heat prediction on Google Cloud Platform.

Before this, she held a postdoctoral position at the **Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research (LISER)**, where she worked on urban planning problems using deep learning and multiview segmentation.

Sally’s research interests span **machine learning**, **deep learning**, **multiview clustering**, **environmental modeling**, and **urban systems**. She has authored or co-authored multiple publications in top-tier journals such as *Information Fusion*, *Knowledge-Based Systems*, and *Sustainable Cities and Society*, and regularly contributes to international conferences.

She is fluent in English, French, and Arabic, and continues to supervise engineering students and collaborate on international R&D projects.
