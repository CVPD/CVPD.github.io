**Ignacio Arganda-Carreras** is an [Ikerbasque Research Associate Professor](https://www.ikerbasque.net/en/ignacio-arganda-carreras) at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) and associated with the Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC) and the Biofisika Institute (Leioa, Spain). He earned his European PhD in Computer Engineering and Telecommunications by the Autonomous University of Madrid (Extraordinary Doctorate Award, 2009) and holds a BSc in Computer Engineering from the same university. He took postdoctoral studies at the department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 2009 to 2013 and at the Jean-Pierre Bourgin Institute of the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA), Versailles, from 2013 to 2015.

He conducted research stays at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley (California, 2002-2004), the Centre for Machine Perception of the Technical University of Prague (2005), and the Applied Medical Research Centre of the University of Navarra in Pamplona (2006) during his doctorate studies. Dr. Arganda-Carreras also worked as a consultant for the Max Planck Institute of Cellular Biology and Genetics in Dresden (2009) and the Institute of Neuroinformatics in Zurich (2009). He was an Ikerbasque Research Fellow at the department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence of the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) from September 2015 to August 2020, and since September 2020, he holds a permanent position in the same department as an [Ikerbasque Research Associate Professor](https://www.ikerbasque.net/en/ignacio-arganda-carreras).

Dr. Arganda-Carreras is an accomplished researcher with extensive experience in image processing and computer vision, spanning various applications such as biomedical image analysis, microscopy, facial image analysis, and autonomous car technology. His current research interests are focused on deep learning-based image segmentation, restoration, super-resolution, object detection, and tracking. Dr. Arganda-Carreras has a prolific publication record, with more than 50 peer-reviewed journal articles in renowned publications such as Bioinformatics, Nature Methods, Nature Communications, Pattern Recognition, and IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, among others. He has also presented over 30 international conference papers. Additionally, Dr. Arganda-Carreras is one of the co-founders of [Fiji](https://fiji.sc), an open-source image processing package that is widely used by the bioimage analysis community.

Since 2015, he has supervised over 20 master's theses, three PhD theses, and is currently supervising the following PhD students:

* **Lenka Backová** (full-time PhD) is working on a thesis titled "Deep Learning-Based Image Analysis and Cell Behavior Prediction of Multicellular Biological Systems" and is expected to defend by the end of 2025.
* **Aitor Gonzalez-Marfil** (full-time PhD) is working on a thesis titled "Deep Self-Supervised Learning methods for biomedical image analysis" and is expected to defend by the end of 2026.
* **Francisco Javier Iriarte-Satrustegui** (part-time PhD, industrial) is working on a thesis titled "A Microservice-Based Approach for Efficient and Explainable AI Sensing on Multi-Sensored Robots" and is expected to defend by the end of 2027.
* **Xabier Lekunberri Mezo** (full-time PhD, industrial) is working on a thesis titled "Image analysis, big data and artificial intelligence to improve fisheries management" and is expected to defend by the end of 2025.
* **Gloria Vázquez Sebrango** (full-time PhD, industrial) is working on a thesis titled "Artificial Intelligence for the atraumatic reversibility of implant treatments" and is expected to defend by the end of 2025.

A young corresponding member of [Jakiunde, the Basque Academy of Sciences, Arts, and Letters](https://www.jakiunde.eus/en/), since 2016, Dr. Arganda-Carreras is also deeply committed to science communication. He has participated in various outreach programs on local radio and television, including Lau Haizetara (Bizkaia Irratia), La Mecánica del Caracol, Faktoria and Norteko Ferrokarrilla (EiTB radio), and Teknopolis (EiTB TV).

In recognition of his research impact, Dr. Arganda-Carreras was included in Stanford University's [Ranking of the World Scientists: World's Top 2% Scientists](https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw/7) in 2022, 2023, and 2024, which highlights influential scientists based on the citation impact of their publications.
