**Ignacio Arganda-Carreras** is an [Ikerbasque Research Associate Professor](https://www.ikerbasque.net/en/ignacio-arganda-carreras) at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) and associated with the Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC) and the Biofisika Institute (Leioa, Spain). He earned his European PhD in Computer Engineering and Telecommunications by the Autonomous University of Madrid (Extraordinary Doctorate Award, 2009) and holds a BSc in Computer Engineering from the same university. He took postdoctoral studies at the department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 2009 to 2013 and at the Jean-Pierre Bourgin Institute of the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA), Versailles, from 2013 to 2015.

He conducted research stays at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley (California, 2002-2004), the Centre for Machine Perception of the Technical University of Prague (2005), and the Applied Medical Research Centre of the University of Navarra in Pamplona (2006) during his doctorate studies. Dr. Arganda-Carreras also worked as a consultant for the Max Planck Institute of Cellular Biology and Genetics in Dresden (2009) and the Institute of Neuroinformatics in Zurich (2009).

He was an Ikerbasque Research Fellow at the department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence of UPV/EHU from September 2015 to August 2020. Since September 2020, he holds a permanent position in the same department as an [Ikerbasque Research Associate Professor](https://www.ikerbasque.net/en/ignacio-arganda-carreras), and has been awarded the R3 accreditation (2023) and one positive Ikerbasque triennial evaluation (2023).

His research focuses on computer vision, image processing, and deep learning, with applications in biomedical imaging, microscopy, facial analysis, and autonomous driving. He is co-founder of [Fiji](https://fiji.sc), a widely used open-source platform for bioimage analysis. He has published over 50 peer-reviewed articles in journals such as *Bioinformatics*, *Nature Methods*, *Nature Communications*, *Pattern Recognition*, and *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, and has contributed to more than 30 international conferences.

Since 2015, he has supervised over 20 Master's theses and three PhD dissertations. He is currently supervising:

- **Lenka Backová** (PhD, full-time): *Deep Learning-Based Image Analysis and Cell Behavior Prediction of Multicellular Biological Systems* (defense expected 2025).
- **Aitor Gonzalez-Marfil** (PhD, full-time): *Deep Self-Supervised Learning Methods for Biomedical Image Analysis* (2026).
- **Francisco Javier Iriarte-Satrustegui** (PhD, part-time, industrial): *A Microservice-Based Approach for Efficient and Explainable AI Sensing on Multi-Sensor Robots* (2027).
- **Xabier Lekunberri Mezo** (PhD, full-time, industrial): *Image Analysis, Big Data and AI to Improve Fisheries Management* (2025).
- **Gloria Vázquez Sebrango** (PhD, full-time, industrial): *AI for Atraumatic Reversibility of Implant Treatments* (2025).

A corresponding member of [Jakiunde, the Basque Academy of Sciences, Arts and Letters](https://www.jakiunde.eus/en/), Dr. Arganda-Carreras is also active in science communication, participating in local outreach programs on radio and television (*Lau Haizetara*, *La Mecánica del Caracol*, *Faktoria*, *Norteko Ferrokarrilla*, and *Teknopolis*).


In recognition of his research impact, Dr. Arganda-Carreras was included in Stanford University's [Ranking of the World Scientists: World's Top 2% Scientists](https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw/7) in 2022, 2023, and 2024, which highlights influential scientists based on the citation impact of their publications.
