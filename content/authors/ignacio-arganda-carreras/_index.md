**Ignacio Arganda-Carreras** is an [Ikerbasque Research Associate Professor](https://www.ikerbasque.net/en/ignacio-arganda-carreras) at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) and associated with the [Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC)](https://dipc.ehu.eus/es/dipc/personas/asociados-dipc/ignacio-arganda-carreras) and the [Biofisika Institute](https://www.biofisika.org/en/about/people/ignacio-arganda-carreras). He earned his European **PhD in Computer Engineering and Telecommunications** by the Autonomous University of Madrid (Extraordinary Doctorate Award, 2009) and holds a BSc in Computer Engineering from the same university. He took postdoctoral studies at the department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences of the **Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)** from 2009 to 2013 and at the Jean-Pierre Bourgin Institute of the **Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA)**, Versailles, from 2013 to 2015.

He conducted research stays at the **Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory** in Berkeley (CA, USA, 2002-2004), the **Centre for Machine Perception** of the Technical University of Prague (2005), and the **Applied Medical Research Centre** of the University of Navarra in Pamplona (2006) during his doctorate studies. Dr. Arganda-Carreras also worked as a consultant for the **Max Planck Institute of Cellular Biology and Genetics** in Dresden (2009) and the **Institute of Neuroinformatics** in Zurich (2009).

He was an Ikerbasque Research Fellow at the department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence of UPV/EHU from September 2015 to August 2020. Since September 2020, he holds a permanent position in the same department as an **[Ikerbasque Research Associate Professor](https://www.ikerbasque.net/en/ignacio-arganda-carreras)**, and has been awarded the **R3 accreditation (2023)** and one positive Ikerbasque triennial evaluation (2023).

His research focuses on **computer vision, image processing, and deep learning, with applications in biomedical imaging, microscopy, facial analysis, and autonomous driving**. He is co-founder of [Fiji](https://fiji.sc), a widely used open-source platform for bioimage analysis. He has published over 50 peer-reviewed articles in journals such as *Bioinformatics*, *Nature Methods*, *Nature Communications*, *Pattern Recognition*, and *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, and has contributed to more than 30 international conferences.

Since 2015, he has supervised over **25 Master's theses and four PhD dissertations**. He is currently supervising:

- **[Lenka Backov치](https://cvpd.github.io/author/lenka-backova/)** (PhD, full-time): *Deep Learning-Based Image Analysis and Cell Behavior Prediction of Multicellular Biological Systems* (defense expected in spring 2026).
- **[Aitor Gonz치lez-Marfil](https://cvpd.github.io/author/aitor-gonzalez-marfil)** (PhD, full-time): *Deep Self-Supervised Learning Methods for Biomedical Image Analysis* (defense expected in 2026).
- **[Francisco Javier Iriarte](https://cvpd.github.io/author/francisco-javier-iriarte/)** (PhD, part-time, industrial): *A Microservice-Based Approach for Efficient and Explainable AI Sensing on Multi-Sensor Robots* (defense expected in 2027).
- **[Xabier Lekunberri](https://cvpd.github.io/author/xabier-lekunberri/)** (PhD, full-time, industrial): *Image Analysis, Big Data and AI to Improve Fisheries Management* (defense expected in 2025).
- **Gloria V치zquez Sebrango** (PhD, full-time, industrial): *AI for Atraumatic Reversibility of Implant Treatments* (defense expected in 2026).
- **[Aitor Iglesias](https://cvpd.github.io/author/aitor-iglesias/)** (PhD, part-time, industrial): *LiDAR-based perception for reliable Automated Driving functions* (defense expected in 2028).

A **corresponding member of [Jakiunde, the Basque Academy of Sciences, Arts and Letters](https://www.jakiunde.eus/en/)**, Dr. Arganda-Carreras is also active in science communication, participating in local outreach programs on radio and television (*Lau Haizetara*[^1], *La Mec치nica del Caracol*[^2]<sup>,</sup>[^3], *Faktoria*[^4], *Norteko Ferrokarrilla*[^5], and *Teknopolis*[^6]).


In recognition of his research impact, Dr. Arganda-Carreras was included in Stanford University's **[Ranking of the World Scientists: World's Top 2% Scientists](https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw/7)** in 2022, 2023, and 2024, which highlights influential scientists based on the citation impact of their publications.
