**Nancy KOZAH** is a PhD student at the University of the Basque Country. She is currently pursuing a PhD under the supervision of [Dr. Fadi Dornaika](https://cvpd.github.io/author/fadi-dornaika/) and [Dr. Jinan Charafeddine](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=IajqKIMAAAAJ&hl=en), with a focus on designing deep learning-based data augmentation techniques for medical image segmentation, and is expected to defend by the end of 2027. She earned an MSc in  in Electronic Engineering Emphasis on Biomedical Engineering (2018) and a BSc in Electronic Engineering Emphasis on Biomedical Engineering(2016), both from the Lebanese International University.

During her PhD, Nancy's research focuses on developing deep learning-based data augmentation techniques to enhance the robustness and generalizability of medical image segmentation models. Her work bridges foundational research in representation learning and generative modeling with practical improvements to training data diversity, addressing the challenge of limited annotated medical datasets. She has also contributed to the evaluation of augmentation methods in cross-domain settings, analyzing their effectiveness in improving generalization across imaging protocols.
Most recently, she presented her evaluation at the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Applications (ICCA), where she reviewed the effectiveness of various data augmentation methods, focusing on their impact on segmentation accuracy and clinical applicability in modern medical imaging.
