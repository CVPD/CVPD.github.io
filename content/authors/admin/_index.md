## Professional Biography

**Fadi Dornaika** is an Ikerbasque Research Professor with a distinguished academic and research career. He earned his Ph.D. from INRIA, France, in 1995, with a thesis focused on geometric modeling for vision and robotics integration. Prior to joining IKERBASQUE, he contributed to groundbreaking research at nine internationally renowned institutes, including INRIA (France), GMD (Germany), The Chinese University of Hong Kong (China), Linköping University (Sweden), the University of Alberta (Canada), York University (Canada), Heudiasyc Laboratory (CNRS, France), the Computer Vision Center (Spain), and the French Geographical Institute (France).

Professor Dornaika has extensive expertise in computer vision and pattern recognition, with research interests spanning a wide range of topics, including computer vision, image processing, pattern recognition, and machine learning. His current focus areas encompass Multiview Clustering, Scalable Semi-Supervised Learning, Structured Semi-Supervised Learning, and Deep Learning, particularly in applications related to medical image analysis. His h-index is 41 (Google Scholar). According to Stanford University's current ranking (Published September 2024), he is in the top 2% of scholars (DOI:10.17632/btchxktzyw.7) based on his citations on career-long data updated to end-of-2023 and single year (2023) impact. He has published more than 400 papers in the field of computer vision, pattern recognition, and machine learning, including 190 indexed journal articles in (IEEE Trans. Robotics & Automation, IEEE Trans. Cybernetics, IEEE Trans. Neural Networks and Learning Systems, IEEE Trans. on Image Processing, IEEE Trans. CSVT, IEEE Trans. SMC, Information Fusion, Information Sciences, Neural Networks, Pattern Recognition, Artificial Intelligence Review, Knowledge-Based Systems, Int. Journal of Computer Vision, Int. Journal of Robotics Research, etc.).

He has participated in two European research projects: (i) SECOND: Sensory Controlled Dextrous Robots (Third FWP), and (ii) MUHCI: Multimodal Human Computer Interaction (Fifth FWP). He was the PI of four Spanish National projects in the period 2005-2022. As of 2017, he is the leader of the Computer Vision and Pattern Discovery group at the University of the Basque Country. He participated in the following projects:
- "Computer Vision Approaches in Low Annotation Regimes: Biomedical and facial image analysis. MICIN, Spain.
- “Advanced machine learning tools”. Collaborative research with Henan University, China.
- “New concepts for deep learning for structured data analysis”. Henan University, China.
- “Novel mechanisms for situational awareness in non-controlled environments for the future AAL”, MICIN, Spain.
- "Age estimation in face images". Lebanese University.
- "Lightweight Human Machine Interaction algorithms for use with mobile devices". University of the Basque Country, UPV/EHU.
- "Advanced Manifold Learning techniques for facial image analysis”. Lebanese University.
- "Terra Numerica : Numérisation et valorisation des territoires et de leurs ressources". Ile de France.
- “Construction of an omnidirectional foveated sensor”. York University, Canada.
