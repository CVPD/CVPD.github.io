The **CARLA** project â€” *"MÃ©todos de visiÃ³n artificial en entornos de pocas anotaciones: anÃ¡lisis de imagen biomÃ©dica y facial"* â€” focuses on the development of AI methods for visual recognition in low-data environments, where annotated datasets are scarce or expensive to obtain.

Led by the **Computer Vision and Pattern Discovery (CVPD)** group at the **University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU)**, CARLA targets two key application domains:

- **Biomedical image analysis**: Enhancing diagnostic tools and research through robust AI-based segmentation and classification under minimal annotation constraints.
- **Facial image analysis**: Improving recognition and aesthetics assessment tasks with annotation-efficient deep learning techniques.

### ðŸ”¬ Scientific Goals

The CARLA project focuses on the development of advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to address two core challenges:

- The **need for large amounts of annotated data** for training state-of-the-art models.
- The **limited generalization capacity** of these models when applied to new but related domains.

Its specific goals are:

- **Develop deep learning techniques** capable of operating in low-annotation settings by leveraging data characteristics, feature representations, and task-specific regularization strategies.

- **Explore domain adaptation and domain generalization approaches** to improve the transferability of models across different but related visual domains (e.g., from one biomedical imaging modality to another).

- **Integrate and validate these techniques** on two application areas:
  - **Biomedical image analysis**, focusing on segmentation and classification tasks.
  - **Facial image analysis**, particularly on face interpretation and aesthetic evaluation.

- **Deliver tools and pipelines** that can be integrated into open-source frameworks, promoting reproducibility, usability, and transfer of methods to real-world scenarios.

The project combines theoretical research with practical experimentation using both synthetic datasets and real annotated collections in the biomedical and facial imaging domains.
