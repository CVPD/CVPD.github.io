The **TOSBI** project — *"Towards Scalable and Generalized Solutions in Biomedical Images"* — aims to develop deep learning methodologies that scale to large bioimage datasets and generalize across imaging modalities and laboratories, with a particular emphasis on annotation-efficient approaches and adapting foundation models to bioimage tasks.

Led by the **Computer Vision and Pattern Discovery (CVPD)** group at the **University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU)**, TOSBI addresses key bottlenecks in modern biomedical image analysis: scarcity of high-quality annotations, computational cost of state-of-the-art models, and limited cross-domain generalization.

### 🔬 Scientific Goals

- Design and evaluate **annotation-efficient learning strategies** (self-supervised, semi-supervised, few-/zero-shot) tailored to biomedical images.
- Improve **scalability** of model training and inference for large microscopy and histopathology datasets.
- Develop **domain adaptation and domain generalization** techniques to transfer models between imaging modalities, labs, or experimental conditions.
- Adapt and validate **foundation models** for downstream bioimage tasks (segmentation, detection, classification), including practical tooling for the community.
- Deliver open and reproducible software components and evaluation pipelines compatible with community platforms (e.g., BiaPy).
