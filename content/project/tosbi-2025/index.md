The **TOSBI** project — *Towards Scalable and Generalized Solutions in Biomedical Images* — aims to create deep learning methodologies that scale to large bioimage datasets and generalize across imaging modalities, laboratories and experimental settings. The project emphasizes annotation-efficient learning and the adaptation of foundation models to biomedical imaging tasks.

Led by the **Computer Vision and Pattern Discovery (CVPD)** group at the **University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU)**, TOSBI addresses central challenges in modern biomedical image analysis: limited high-quality annotations, the computational cost of state-of-the-art models, and the difficulty of achieving robust cross-domain generalization.

### 🔬 Scientific Goals

- Develop and benchmark **annotation-efficient learning strategies** (self-supervised, semi-supervised, few-shot and zero-shot) tailored to biomedical imaging.
- Improve **scalability** of training and inference workflows for large microscopy and histopathology datasets.
- Create **domain adaptation and domain generalization** methods enabling models to transfer across imaging modalities, laboratories or acquisition conditions.
- Adapt and validate **foundation models** for downstream bioimage tasks (segmentation, detection, classification), providing practical tools for the research community.
- Release open and reproducible software components and evaluation pipelines fully compatible with community platforms such as **BiaPy**.
