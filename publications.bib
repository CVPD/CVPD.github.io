ABSTRACT = {Cancer cell invasion through tissue barriers is the intrinsic feature of metastasis, the most life-threatening aspect of cancer. Detailed observation and analysis of cancer cell behaviour in a 3D environment is essential for a full understanding of the mechanisms of cancer cell invasion. The inherent limits of optical microscopy resolution do not allow to for in-depth observation of intracellular structures, such as invadopodia of invading cancer cells. The required resolution can be achieved using electron microscopy techniques such as FIB-SEM. However, visualising cells in a 3D matrix using FIB-SEM is challenging due to difficulties with localisation of a specific cell deep within the resin block. We have developed a new protocol based on the near-infrared branding (NIRB) procedure that extends the pattern from the surface grid deep inside the resin. This 3D burned pattern allows for precise trimming followed by targeted 3D FIB-SEM. Here we present detailed 3D CLEM results combining confocal and FIB-SEM imaging of cancer cell invadopodia that extend deep into the collagen meshwork.},

  abstract={In embryos, epithelial sealing proceeds with progressive zipping eventually leading to a scar-free epithelium and ensuring the assembly of body segments in insects and neural tube in mammals. How zipping is mechanically controlled to promote tissue fusion on long distances, remains unclear. Combining physical modeling with genetic and mechanical perturbations, we reveal the existence of a transient contractile seam that generates forces to reduce the zipping angle by force balance, consequently promoting epidermal sealing during Drosophila embryogenesis. The seam is formed by the adhesion of two tissues, the epidermis and amnioserosa, and is stabilized by the tensions generated by the segment boundaries. Once a segment is zipped, the seam disassembles concurrently with the inactivation of the Jun kinase pathway. Thus, we show that epithelial sealing is promoted by a transient actomyosin contractile seam allowing sequential segment assembly.}

  abstract={Background: Sperm metabolic pathways that generate energy for motility are compartmentalized within the flagellum. Dysfunctions in metabolic compartments, namely mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis, can compromise motility and male fertility. Studying these compartments is thus required for fertility treatment. However, it is very challenging to capture images of metabolic compartments in motile spermatozoa because the fast beating of the flagellum introduces motion blur. Therefore, most approaches immobilize spermatozoa prior to imaging. Results: Our findings indicate that immobilizing sperm alters their metabolic profile, highlighting the necessity for measuring metabolism in spermatozoa during movement. We achieved this by encapsulating mouse epididymis in a hydrogel followed by two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy for imaging motile sperm in situ. The autofluorescence of endogenous metabolites—FAD, NADH, and NADPH—enabled us to visualize sperm metabolic compartments without staining. We trained machine learning for automated image segmentation and generated metabolic fingerprints using object-based phasor analysis. We show that metabolic fingerprints of spermatozoa and the mitochondrial compartment (1) can distinguish individual males by genetic background, age, or fecundity status, (2) correlate with fertility, and (3) change with age likely due to increased oxidative metabolism. Conclusions: Our approach eliminates the need for sperm immobilization and labeling and captures the native state of sperm metabolism. This technique could be adapted for metabolism-based sperm selection for assisted reproduction.}
