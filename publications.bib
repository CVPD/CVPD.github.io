  abstract     = {Semi-supervised learning with a graph-based approach has gained prominence in machine learning, particularly in scenarios where labeling data involves substantial costs. Graph convolution networks (GCNs) have found widespread application in semi-supervised learning, predominantly on graph-structured data such as citation and social networks. However, a noticeable gap exists in the application of these methods to non-graph multi-view data, such as collections of images. In an effort to address this gap, we introduce two innovative deep semi-supervised multi-view classification models specifically tailored for non-graph data. Both models share a common architecture, leveraging GCNs and integrating a label smoothing constraint. The primary distinction lies in the construction of the consensus similarity graph. The first model directly reconstructs the consensus graph from different views using a specialized objective function designed for flexible graph-based semi-supervised classification. In contrast, the second model independently reconstructs individual graphs and subsequently adaptively merges them into a unified consensus graph. Our experiments encompass various multiple-view image datasets. The results consistently demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach compared to traditional fusion methods with GCNs. In this research, we present two approaches for tackling semi-supervised classification challenges involving multiple views. One method is named Semi-supervised Classification with a Unified Graph (SCUG), and the other is referred to as Semi-supervised Classification with a Fused Graph (SC-Fused). Both methods share a common semi-supervised classification process, utilizing the GCN framework and incorporating label smoothing. However, the key distinction lies in the construction of the similarity graph. Unlike traditional ad hoc graph construction approaches, our proposed methods, SCUG and SC-Fused, estimate the unified graph or individual graphs, respectively, alongside the labels. This results in more optimized graphs that benefit from data smoothing and the semi-supervised context.}

  abstract = {In recent years, semi-supervised learning on graphs has gained importance in many fields and applications. The goal is to use both partially labeled data (labeled examples) and a large amount of unlabeled data to build more effective predictive models. Deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are very useful in both unsupervised and semi-supervised learning problems. As a special class of GNNs, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) aim to obtain data representation through graph-based node smoothing and layer-wise neural network transformations. However, GCNs have some weaknesses when applied to semi-supervised graph learning: (1) it ignores the manifold structure implicitly encoded by the graph; (2) it uses a fixed neighborhood graph and focuses only on the convolution of a graph, but pays little attention to graph construction; (3) it rarely considers the problem of topological imbalance. To overcome the above shortcomings, in this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning method called Re-weight Nodes and Graph Learning Convolutional Network with Manifold Regularization (ReNode-GLCNMR). Our proposed method simultaneously integrates graph learning and graph convolution into a unified network architecture, which also enforces label smoothing through an unsupervised loss term. At the same time, it addresses the problem of imbalance in graph topology by adaptively reweighting the influence of labeled nodes based on their distances to the class boundaries. Experiments on 8 benchmark datasets show that ReNode-GLCNMR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-supervised GNN methods.}

  abstract = {Deep Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have gained increasing prominence across various fields and applications in recent years. In particular, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), a specialized GNN, has emerged as a powerful tool for obtaining data representations through the processes of graph-based node smoothing and implementing transformations through neural networks layer by layer. Although GCN excels in the area of semi-supervised learning, it also has its weaknesses. In particular, it 1) tends to overlook the implicit manifold structure of graph data, 2) focuses primarily on graph convolutions, often neglects the graph construction, and 3) rarely addresses topological imbalances. In response to these limitations, we present a comprehensive deep semi-supervised Graph Learning approach incorporating Node Re-weighting and Manifold Regularization (ReNode-GLCNMR). This innovative approach corrects topological inconsistencies in the graph and adaptively reweights labeled nodes. It also seamlessly combines graph learning and graph convolution within one GCN architecture. Moreover, it imposes label smoothing by utilizing an unsupervised loss item. Our experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that our ReNode-GLCNMR model surpasses the performance of the most advanced semi-supervised GNN methods available.}
