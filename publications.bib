  abstract={Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL) has received much attention. On the other hand, less attention has been paid to the problem of large-scale GSSL for inductive multi-class classification. Existing scalable GSSL methods rely on a hard linear constraint. They cannot predict the labelling of test samples, or use predefined graphs, which limits their applications and performance. In this paper, we propose an inductive algorithm that can handle large databases by using anchors. The main contribution compared to existing scalable semi-supervised models is the integration of the anchor graph computation into the learned model. We develop a criterion to jointly estimate the unlabeled sample labels, the mapping of the feature space to the label space, and the affinity matrix of the anchor graph. Furthermore, the fusion of labels and features of anchors is used to construct the graph. Using the projection matrix, it can also predict the labels of the test samples by linear transformation. Experimental results on the large datasets NORB, RCV1 and Covtype show the effectiveness, scalability and superiority of the proposed method. The code of the proposed method can be found at the following link https://github.com/ZoulfikarIB/SGRFME .},

abstract = {Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL) has garnered significant interest in the realms of machine learning and pattern recognition. Although some of the proposed methods have made some progress, there are still some shortcomings that need to be overcome. There are three main limitations. First, the graphs used in these approaches are usually predefined regardless of the task at hand. Second, due to the use of graphs, almost all approaches are unable to process and consider data with a very large number of unlabeled samples. Thirdly, the imbalance of the topology of the samples is very often not taken into account. In particular, processing large datasets with GSSL might pose challenges in terms of computational resource feasibility. In this article, we present a scalable and inductive GSSL method. We broaden the scope of the graph topology imbalance paradigm to extensive databases. Second, we employ the calculated weights of the labeled sample for the label-matching term in the global objective function. This leads to a unified, scalable, semi-supervised learning model that allows simultaneous labeling of unlabeled data, projection of the feature space onto the labeling space, along with the graph matrix of anchors. In the proposed scheme, the integration of labels and features from anchors is applied for the adaptive construction of the anchor graph. Experimental results were performed on four large databases: NORB, RCV1, Covtype, and MNIST. These experiments demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior performance when compared to existing scalable semi-supervised learning models.},

  abstract={Despite the advances in semi-supervised learning methods, these algorithms face three limitations. The first is the assumption of pre-constructed graphs and the second is their inability to process large databases. The third limitation is that these methods ignore the topological imbalance of the data in a graph. In this paper, we address these limitations and propose a new approach called Weighted Simultaneous Graph Construction and Reduced Flexible Manifold Embedding (W-SGRFME). To overcome the first limitation, we construct the affinity graph using an automatic algorithm within the learning process. The second limitation concerns the ability of the model to handle a large number of unlabeled samples. To this end, the anchors are included in the algorithm as data representatives, and an inductive algorithm is used to estimate the labeling of a large number of unseen samples. To address the topological imbalance of the data samples, we introduced the Renode method to assign weights to the labeled samples. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experimental results on two large datasets commonly used in semi-supervised learning: Covtype and MNIST. The results demonstrate the superiority of the W-SGRFME method over two recently proposed models and emphasize its effectiveness in dealing with large datasets.}
