abstract = {Multi-view clustering has attracted much attention recently. Among all clustering approaches, spectral ones have gained much popularity thanks to an elaborated and solid theoretical foundation. A major limitation of spectral clustering based methods is that these methods only provide a non-linear projection of the data, to which an additional step of clustering is required. This can degrade the quality of the final clustering due to various factors such as the initialization process or outliers. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a constrained version of a recent method called Multiview Spectral Clustering via integrating Nonnegative Embedding and Spectral Embedding. Besides retaining the advantages of this method, our proposed model integrates two types of constraints: (i) a consistent smoothness of the nonnegative embedding over all views and (ii) an orthogonality constraint over the columns of the nonnegative embedding. Experimental results on several real datasets show the superiority of the proposed approach.}

abstract = {Recently, one-step clustering methods have shown good performance. However, very few one-step approaches have addressed the multi-view case, where an instance may have multiple representations. Data can be represented with multiple heterogeneous views. Clustering with multiple views faces the challenge of how to combine all the different views. A general scheme is to represent the views by view-based graphs and/or a consensus graph. Graphs can be well suited for clustering problems since they can capture the local and global structure of the data. In this paper, we present a novel approach to one-step graph-based multi-view clustering. In contrast to existing graph-based one-step clustering methods, our proposed method introduces two key innovations. First, we build an additional graph by using the cluster label correlation to the graphs associated with the data space. Second, a smoothing constraint is exploited to constrain the cluster-label matrix and make it more consistent with the original data graphs as well as with and label graphs. Experimental results on several public datasets show the efficiency of the proposed approach. All cluster evaluation metrics show significant improvement by applying our method to different types and sizes of datasets. The average improvement (across all datasets) is the difference between the indicator obtained by our approach and the indicator obtained by the most competitive method. The average improvement is approximately 4%, 2%, 3%, and 2% for the Accuracy indicator, the Normalized Mutual Information indicator, the Purity indicator, and the Adjusted Rand index, respectively.}

abstract = {Recently, multi-view clustering has received much attention in the fields of machine learning and pattern recognition. Spectral clustering for single and multiple views has been the common solution. Despite its good clustering performance, it has a major limitation: it requires an extra step of clustering. This extra step, which could be the famous k-means clustering, depends heavily on initialization, which may affect the quality of the clustering result. To overcome this problem, a new method called Multi-view Clustering via Consensus Graph Learning and Nonnegative Embedding (MVCGE) is presented in this paper. In the proposed approach, the consensus affinity matrix (graph matrix), consensus representation and cluster index matrix (nonnegative embedding) are learned simultaneously in a unified framework. Our proposed method takes as input the different kernel matrices corresponding to the different views. The proposed learning model integrates two interesting constraints: (i) the cluster indices should be as smooth as possible over the consensus graph and (ii) the cluster indices are set to be as close as possible to the graph convolution of the consensus representation. In this approach, no post-processing such as k-means or spectral rotation is required. Our approach is tested with real and synthetic datasets. The experiments performed show that the proposed method performs well compared to many state-of-the-art approaches.}

abstract = {Recently, clustering data collected from various sources has become a hot topic in real-world applications. The most common methods for multi-view clustering can be divided into several categories: Spectral clustering algorithms, subspace multi-view clustering algorithms, matrix factorization approaches, and kernel methods. Despite the high performance of these methods, they directly fuse all similarity matrices of all views and separate the affinity learning process from the multiview clustering process. The performance of these algorithms can be affected by noisy affinity matrices. To overcome this drawback, this paper presents a novel method called One Step Multi-view Clustering via Consensus Graph Learning and Nonnegative Embedding (OSMGNE). Instead of directly merging the similarity matrices of different views, which may contain noise, a step of learning a consensus similarity matrix is performed. This step forces the similarity matrices of different views to be too similar, which eliminates the problem of noisy data. Moreover, the use of the nonnegative embedding matrix (soft cluster assignment matrix makes it possible to directly obtain the final clustering result without any extra step. The proposed method can solve five subtasks simultaneously. It jointly estimates the similarity matrix of all views, the similarity matrix of each view, the corresponding spectral projection matrix, the unified clustering indicator matrix, and automatically gives the weight of each view without the use of hyper-parameters. In addition, another version of our method is also studied in this paper. This method differs from the first one by using a consensus spectral projection matrix and a consensus Laplacian matrix over all views. An iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem of these two methods. The two proposed methods are tested on several real datasets, which prove their superiority.}

abstract = {The most widely used multi-view clustering approaches can be classified into different groups: Subspace multi-view clustering algorithms, multi-view kernel approaches, matrix factorization approaches, and spectral clustering algorithms. Most approaches rely on combining predefined individual similarity matrices from multiple views, and then estimate the common similarity matrix. Therefore, their performance can be severely affected by noisy original similarity matrices. Moreover, most of these methods integrate different spectral projection matrices of each view together, which can also affect the clustering results. To address these shortcomings, we propose a single-phase multiview clustering method with Consensus Graph Learning and Spectral Representation (MCGLSR) in this paper. Instead of directly integrating the similarity matrices of the different views, which could introduce noise, our proposed method jointly generates similarity graphs of the views and their common similarity matrix (graph matrix) using a unified global objective function. At this stage, the similarity matrices of the different views are enforced to be sufficiently similar, which eliminates the problem of noise and promotes a clearer unified data structure. Moreover, our proposed objective function is able to recover the common spectral projection and soft cluster assignments based on the common graph structure. The proposed method takes as input a kernelized representation of the views features and directly provides the individual graphs, the common graph, the common spectral representation, and the cluster assignments. Our technique allows us to obtain the final cluster assignments without requiring an external clustering algorithm. Several real-world datasets are used to evaluate our technique and demonstrate its efficacy. The code of the proposed method will be available at the following link: https://github.com/SallyHajjar/MCGLSR.git.}

Most existing methods perform this task in three sequential phases: Estimating individual or consistent similarity matrices, spectral embedding, and cluster partitioning. In this paper, we present a novel method that can overcome some of the shortcomings of previous multi-view clustering methods. Our approach is called "Multi-view Clustering via Kernelized Graph and Nonnegative Embedding". Based on a single global criterion, it can jointly provide the consistent similarity matrix for all views, the consistent spectral representation, the soft cluster assignments, and the view weights. To our knowledge, our approach is the first to combine all these unknown matrices into a single criterion. Our proposed scheme has two interesting properties that the recent works do not have simultaneously. First, the proposed approach does not require an additional clustering step since the clustering assignments are solved directly. Second, the soft cluster assignments are directly linked to the representation of the views. Several experiments on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Given the prevalence of COVID-19 cases and the extensive volume of patient records lacking labels, this communication underscores our unique approach—conducting the first study on COVID-19 case diagnosis in an unsupervised manner. Our work operates under the assumption of prior knowledge regarding the number of classes, such as COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal, in a case study. By adopting an unsupervised learning paradigm, we leverage the wealth of unlabeled data, reducing dependence on human experts for annotating numerous images. This paper introduces an enhanced version of a recent direct method where non-negative cluster indices and spectral embeddings are jointly estimated. Beyond the inherent advantages of this method, our proposed model introduces improvements through two additional types of constraints: (i) ensuring consistent smoothing of cluster labels across all views and (ii) imposing an orthogonality constraint on the matrix of cluster assignments. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated using the public COVIDx dataset with three classes, showcasing promising results in categorizing radiographs. The proposed approach is tested on other public image datasets to assess its effectiveness.}

  abstract={Clustering data from different sources or views is a key challenge in real-world applications. While traditional graph-based methods are effective at capturing data structures, they often require separate steps to estimate graphs of views or a consensus graph from the raw data. This reliance on intermediate steps can make these clustering methods susceptible to noisy graphs, which affects the overall performance of clustering. In response to this limitation, and with an emphasis on advocating end-to-end solutions for multi-view clustering, two comprehensive approaches are presented in this paper. Each approach starts from either the raw data or its kernelized features. The first proposal introduces a unified objective function that enables the simultaneous recovery of the graph for each view, the unified graph, the spectral projection matrices for all views, the soft cluster assignments, and the scores assigned to each view. The second proposal uses a global criterion that integrates regularization and constraints for the soft cluster assignment matrix based on the consensus graph matrix and the consensus data representation. Both proposed methods enable direct and straightforward clustering of the data without the need for additional steps. Extensive tests with various real-world image and text datasets confirm the superior performance of the two proposed methods.},

  abstract={Integrating data from multiple sources or views has become increasingly common in data analysis, particularly in fields like healthcare, finance, and social sciences. However, clustering such multi-view data poses unique challenges due to the heterogeneity and complexity of the data sources. Traditional clustering methods are often unable to effectively leverage the information from different views, leading to suboptimal clustering results. To address this challenge, multi-view clustering techniques have been developed, aiming to integrate information from multiple views to improve clustering performance. These techniques typically involve learning a similarity matrix for each view and then combining these matrices to form a consensus similarity matrix, which is subsequently used for clustering. However, existing approaches often suffer from limitations such as the need for manual tuning of parameters and the inability to effectively capture the underlying structure of the data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for multi-view clustering that addresses these limitations by jointly learning the consensus coefficient matrix and similarity graph. Unlike existing methods that follow a sequential approach of first learning the coefficient matrix and then constructing the similarity graph, our approach simultaneously learns both matrices, ensuring a more regularized consensus graph. Additionally, our method automatically adjusts the weight of each view, eliminating the need for manual parameter tuning. Our approach involves several key steps. First, we formulate an optimization problem that jointly optimizes the consensus coefficient matrix, unified spectral projection matrix, coefficient matrix, and soft cluster assignment matrix. We then propose an efficient algorithm to solve this optimization problem, which involves iteratively updating the matrices until convergence. To learn the consensus coefficient matrix and similarity graph, we leverage techniques from matrix factorization and graph-based learning. Specifically, we use a self-representation technique to learn the coefficient matrix (regularization graPh) and a graph regularization technique to learn the similarity graph. By jointly optimizing these matrices, we ensure that the resulting consensus graph is more regularized and better captures the underlying structure of the data. We evaluate our approach on several public image datasets, comparing it against state-of-the-art multi-view clustering methods. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of clustering accuracy and robustness. Additionally, we conduct sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of different hyperparameters on the clustering performance. We present a novel approach for multi-view data clustering that jointly learns the consensus coefficient matrix and similarity graph. By simultaneously optimizing these matrices, our approach achieves better clustering performance compared to existing methods. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach across different datasets, highlighting its potential for real-world applications in various domains.},

This susceptibility to noisy original similarity matrices, along with the integration of various spectral projection matrices, often affects their overall performance. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel approach named multi-view clustering with consensus graph learning and spectral representation (MCGLSR). In contrast to the traditional practice of directly integrating similarity matrices from different views, which may introduce noise, our proposed method simultaneously generates similarity graphs for each view and their shared similarity matrix (graph matrix) through a unified global objective function. This unified objective function ensures that the similarity matrices from different views are compelled to be sufficiently similar, effectively mitigating the impact of noise and promoting a more coherent unified data structure. Moreover, our approach facilitates the recovery of the common spectral projection and soft cluster assignments based on the shared graph structure. Crucially, MCGLSR operates on a kernelized representation of the views' features, producing individual graphs, a common graph, a common spectral representation, and cluster assignments directly. This eliminates the need for an external clustering algorithm in the final stage. To validate the efficacy of our technique, we conduct experiments on several real-world datasets, demonstrating its robust performance and addressing the identified shortcomings in existing approaches.",
